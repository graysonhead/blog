Even though I have never written anything in Unity (and probably never will, especially given recent events.) I still find a lot of his videos inspirational.\nOne of his videos in particular spurred me to do something I previously didn't have a whole lot of interest in: procedurally generating meshes. So I decided to go about implementing his idea in Bevy with a few twists.\nWhile his video was a excellent starting spot, C# and Rust are drastically different languages so translating between them didn't always get me the results I expected. In addition, there were some bits he glossed over (forgivable, otherwise the video would have been 6 hours long) that I felt deserved a bit more explanation in text form.\nNow, some disclaimers; I'm probably not going to be able to publish the full source of this project because the assets are far too large for Github. I may publish a torrent magnet link or something at some point, but if you want to follow along you will need to fill in some of the blank spots yourself as I'm going to be sharing piecemeal examples to illustrate some of the parts I found more difficult or less obvious (And yes, I know I just complained about people glossing over things. Sorry, not sorry.) If you have questions, feel free to reach out to me (mastadon is probably the best way.)\nAlso, fair warning, the example code is not minimal in any way and will be quite dense. It took me weeks to learn this stuff, so unpacking it all in a blog post is bound to be an interesting exercise.\nSo, disclaimer out of the way, lets get started.\nFrom Planes, A Sphere\nLike in Sebastian's video, I'm also going to construct my earth from a set of planes. However, I wanted to be able to subdivide the earth into more than 6 planes as I wanted to support higher levels of zoom with higher resolution meshes. More objects means more culling (since you don't have to send quite as much data to the videocard memory at any given time) so my method is a little harder to follow than Sebastians:\npub fn generate_face(\n    normal: Vec3,\n    resolution: u32,\n    x_offset: f32,\n    y_offset: f32,\n) -&gt; Mesh {\n    let axis_a = Vec3::new(normal.y, normal.z, normal.x); // Horizontal\n    let axis_b = axis_a.cross(normal); // Vertical\n\n    // Create a vec of verticies and indicies\n    let mut verticies: Vec&lt;Vec3&gt; = Vec::new();\n    let mut indicies: Vec&lt;u32&gt; = Vec::new();\n    let mut normals = Vec::new();\n    for y in 0..(resolution) {\n        for x in 0..(resolution) {\n            let i = x + y * resolution;\n\n            let percent = Vec2::new(x as f32, y as f32) / (resolution - 1) as f32;\n            let point_on_unit_cube =\n                normal + (percent.x - x_offset) * axis_a + (percent.y - y_offset) * axis_b;\n            let point_coords: Coordinates = point_on_unit_cube.normalize().into();\n\n\t\t\tlet normalized_point = point_on_unit_cube.normalize() * EARTH_RADIUS;\n\n            verticies.push(normalized_point);\n\n            normals.push(-point_on_unit_cube.normalize());\n\n            if x != resolution - 1 &amp;&amp; y != resolution - 1 {\n                // First triangle\n                indicies.push(i);\n                indicies.push(i + resolution);\n                indicies.push(i + resolution + 1);\n\n                // Second triangle\n                indicies.push(i);\n                indicies.push(i + resolution + 1);\n                indicies.push(i + 1);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    let indicies = mesh::Indices::U32(indicies);\n    let mut mesh = Mesh::new(PrimitiveTopology::TriangleList);\n    mesh.set_indices(Some(indicies));\n    mesh.insert_attribute(Mesh::ATTRIBUTE_POSITION, verticies);\n    mesh.insert_attribute(Mesh::ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL, normals);\n    mesh.generate_tangents().unwrap();\n    mesh\n}\n\nSo, lets break this down a bit further:\npub fn generate_face(\n    normal: Vec3,\n    resolution: u32,\n    x_offset: f32,\n    y_offset: f32,\n) -&gt; Mesh {\n\nStarting with the signature, we are going to generate a plane facing in a direction, the direction is determined by the normal. This will make more sense when we look a the wrapper function that calls this one.\nOur resolution determines the number of vertices we will generate.\nThe x_offset and y_offset will determine the offset from the central vector. This might not be very intuitive, but it allows us to generate more than 1 plane per \"side\" of the cube (that we will then turn into a sphere.) Again, this will be clearer once we see the wrapper function.\nAnd our output will be a Mesh.\nlet axis_a = Vec3::new(normal.y, normal.z, normal.x); // Horizontal\nlet axis_b = axis_a.cross(normal); // Vertical\n\nFrom our normal direction, we can derive the direction of our x and y axes of the plane. Fortunately this is very easy as Bevy provides some nice helper methods.\nThen we initialize some things we will push various kinds of data into\n// Create a vec of verticies and indicies\nlet mut verticies: Vec&lt;Vec3&gt; = Vec::new();\nlet mut indicies: Vec&lt;u32&gt; = Vec::new();\nlet mut normals = Vec::new();\n\nAnd now it gets a little more interesting.\nfor y in 0..(resolution) {\n        for x in 0..(resolution) {\n            let i = x + y * resolution;\n\n            let percent = Vec2::new(x as f32, y as f32) / (resolution - 1) as f32;\n            let point_on_unit_cube =\n                normal + (percent.x - x_offset) * axis_a + (percent.y - y_offset) * axis_b;\n            let point_coords: Coordinates = point_on_unit_cube.normalize().into();\n\t\t\tlet normalized_point = point_on_unit_cube.normalize() * EARTH_RADIUS;\n\n            verticies.push(normalized_point);\n\n            normals.push(-point_on_unit_cube.normalize());\n\n            if x != resolution - 1 &amp;&amp; y != resolution - 1 {\n                // First triangle\n                indicies.push(i);\n                indicies.push(i + resolution);\n                indicies.push(i + resolution + 1);\n\n                // Second triangle\n                indicies.push(i);\n                indicies.push(i + resolution + 1);\n                indicies.push(i + 1);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nThe first part is probably pretty intuitive, we have a loop for y and x in resolution. This means that a resolution of 100 will result in 100x100 verticies per face. Next we have this i value, which is an Index. An index for what you might ask? Don't get ahead of yourself, we are going to spend a lot of time talking about this index in a minute.\nlet percent = Vec2::new(x as f32, y as f32) / (resolution - 1) as f32;\n\nWe need to know how far along we are with each face, so this will keep track of that in a vec2 for the x and y axis respectively.\nlet point_on_unit_cube =\n\tnormal + (percent.x - x_offset) * axis_a + (percent.y - y_offset) * axis_b;\nlet point_coords: Coordinates = point_on_unit_cube.normalize().into();\nlet normalized_point = point_on_unit_cube.normalize() * EARTH_RADIUS;\n\nNow we generate the actual xyz coordinates of our sphere. Now it may have seemed like we were going to generate a cube out of planes and then flatten them later, but in reality its a lot easier to do this in one step.\nFirst we need to get the point on unit cube, this would be the pre-sphere point (if you used these coordinates for the verticies, it would actually be a cube with flat sides.) This is done by taking the normal and adding the normal plus our x and y percents, minus our x and y offset, times our axis_a and axis_b vectors.\nNext, we take the resulting Vec3 and normalize it. This is the step where our cube becomes a sphere. \nNow that we have the normalized point, we can make the earth whatever radius we want, in this case I'm using a constant of 300.0, but you can make it whatever radius you want.\nverticies.push(normalized_point);\nnormals.push(-point_on_unit_cube.normalize());\n\nNow we need to push our normalized point to our verticies vec. Additionally, we will re-use our point_on_unit_cube variable to set the normal for this vertex correctly. This step probably isn't necessary; all of my normals were the correct way (we will talk about why in a second), but it is probably a good practice.\nif x != resolution - 1 &amp;&amp; y != resolution - 1 {\n\t// First triangle\n\tindicies.push(i);\n\tindicies.push(i + resolution);\n\tindicies.push(i + resolution + 1);\n\n\t// Second triangle\n\tindicies.push(i);\n\tindicies.push(i + resolution + 1);\n\tindicies.push(i + 1);\n}\n\nNow we need to unwrap this. In doing so, we will learn a fundemental truth of video-cards:\nEverything Is a Triangle\nSo we have a list of verticies already, and its probably rather intuitive that these verticies will make up the points of our mesh. But how do we draw the lines between each adjacent vertex in our plane? Heck, which vertexes do we draw lines between in the first place?\nTo answer this question, we have to talk about video cards. Video cards can only draw triangles 1. As a result, we need to construct our mesh from triangles. There are a lot of ways to do that, but we will be using Bevy's PrimitiveTopology::TriangleList.\nThis is one of the more primitive ways of constructing a mesh, but its also the closest to how the video card is actually going to render things which makes it very powerful (and often a bit less confusing for simpler shapes, like a plane.)\nTo generate this kind of mesh, we need two things (at a minium).\n\nA list of Vertex positions\nA list of Indicies that defining triangles\n\nTo explain this, lets start with a simple 2d example:\n\n (0, 0)              (1, 0)\n\n   ┌───────────────────┐\n   │                   │\n   │                   │\n   │                   │\n   │                   │\n   │                   │\n   │                   │\n   │                   │\n   └───────────────────┘\n\n (0, 1)              (1, 1)\n\n\nSince we must create our mesh from triangles, we need two triangles to re-create this box. For example:\nTriangle 1: [(0,0), (1,0), (0,1)]\nTriangle 2: [(0,1), (1,0), (1,1)]\n\nHowever, this isn't going to work for our video card, because the order in which you specify the verticies is extremely important. In order to save a ton of memory and GPU cycles, most graphics libraries implement something called \"backface culling\" by default. This means they will only render one side of each triangle. So how do you tell the videocard which side of the face is the \"front\" vs the \"back\"?\nAccording to the docs:\nVertex winding order: by default, StandardMaterial.cull_mode is Some\n(Face::Back), which means that Bevy would only render the “front” of each \ntriangle, which is the side of the triangle from where the vertices appear \nin a counter-clockwise order.\n\nThis is our answer, the winding order of the verticies tells the videocard which side of the triangle is the \"front\" vs \"back.\" If you want the face facing you, you wind from the counter-clockwise direction when looking at it from the outside (Or the \"normal\" direction.)\nSo a valid set of triangles for our example could be:\n1: [(1,0), (0,0), (0,1)]\n2: [(1,1), (1,0), (0,1)]\n\nBut how do we specify that in Bevy? Now we need to return to the Index we glossed over earlier.\nRemember I said before we needed two things: A list of Verticies and an index that defines triangles? Well now that we know they must be counter-clockwise, we are armed with all the information we need to go about making them.\nSo, our list of verticies could be:\n[(0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)]\n\nAnd the indexes for our two triangles could be:\n[0, 1, 2, 0, 2, 1]\n\nThis would mean our two triangles are:\n1: [(1,0), (0,0), (0,1)]\n2: [(1,1), (1,0), (0,1)]\n\nIf you aren't sure you got that, read it again and try to let it sink in. Its not intuitive at all, so don't feel bad if doesn't make much sense at first.\nOnce you grok that, we can go back to the code that generates our indexes:\nif x != resolution - 1 &amp;&amp; y != resolution - 1 {\n\t// First triangle\n\tindicies.push(i);\n\tindicies.push(i + resolution);\n\tindicies.push(i + resolution + 1);\n\n\t// Second triangle\n\tindicies.push(i);\n\tindicies.push(i + resolution + 1);\n\tindicies.push(i + 1);\n}\n\nNow, lets apply this to our 2d box example (which has a resolution of 2):\nStarting at index 0, our first triangle indexes are:\n(i, i+1, i+1+1)\n\nOr:\n(0, 1, 2)\n\nAnd our second triangle indexes are:\n(i, i+1+1, i+1)\n\nOr:\n(0, 2, 1)\n\nNote that this strategy is entirely dependent on the way our loops are structured:\nfor y in 0..(resolution) {\n\tfor x in 0..(resolution) {\n\t}\n}\n\nBecause we are iterating over the y axis first and creating columns along the x axis, we need our index to look like:\n\n 0                     2\n\n   ┌───────────────────┐\n   │                   │\n   │                   │\n   │                   │\n   │                   │\n   │                   │\n   │                   │\n   │                   │\n   └───────────────────┘\n\n 1                      3\n\n\nAnd the last important bit is our if condition of x != resolution - 1 &amp;&amp; y != resolution - 1. This ensures that we stop making triangles when we get to the end of a row or column.\nNow, we need a function to wrap this one that will generate all sides of our cube-sphere:\npub fn generate_faces(\n    mut commands: Commands,\n    mut meshes: ResMut&lt;Assets&lt;Mesh&gt;&gt;,\n    mut materials: ResMut&lt;Assets&lt;StandardMaterial&gt;&gt;,\n    asset_server: Res&lt;AssetServer&gt;,\n) {\n    let faces = vec![\n        Vec3::X,\n        Vec3::NEG_X,\n        Vec3::Y,\n        Vec3::NEG_Y,\n        Vec3::Z,\n        Vec3::NEG_Z,\n    ];\n\n    let offsets = vec![(0.0, 0.0), (0.0, 1.0), (1.0, 0.0), (1.0, 1.0)];\n\n    let mut rng = rand::thread_rng();\n\n    for direction in faces {\n        for offset in &amp;offsets {\n            commands.spawn((\n                PbrBundle {\n                    mesh: meshes.add(generate_face(direction, 16, offset.0, offset.1, &amp;rs)),\n                    material: materials.add(StandardMaterial {\n                        ..default()\n                    }),\n                    ..default()\n                }\n            ));\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nThis function will generate 24 faces, 4 per side of the \"cube\". The offsets and vectors hopefully make a bit more sense now.\nThe nice thing is, this method scales up to any resolution, so you can play around with varying polygon counts very easily.\nAnd, here is what the end result looks like:\n\nNot looking very interesting yet, is it? Don't worry, we will fix that soon! Stay tuned for Part 2.\n1\nThis is an Oversimplification. Video cards can draw all kinds of polygons in 2d. But in a 3d mesh, everything is always decomposed to triangles first. The chief reason being: 3 verticies is the exact number you need to uniquely specify a plane.\n\n","id":"https://blog.graysonhead.net/posts/bevy-proc-earth-1/","title":"Bevy Procedural Earth Part 1: Mesh"},"https://blog.graysonhead.net/posts/bevy-proc-earth-2/":{"body":"\nIn part one of this project, we went over the basics of mathematically constructing a mesh. At the end of it we were left with a segmented, but very boring grey sphere:\n\nObviously this is no fun, we want to get some textures on it. \nNow, there are lots of ways we could go about wrapping our texture, but I'm going to go about this in a somewhat unusual way. Since we are texturing a planet, and we have a lot of different maps with different projections to pick from, we are going to just select an appropriate one and calculate all our texture coordinates with latitude/longitude coordinates.\nCoordinate Systems Disambiguated\nBy the end of this article, we will have 3 different coordinate systems involved in procedurally generating our facsimile earth, they are:\nBevy's Cartesian Coordinates\nThese are the X, Y, Z triplet that identifies the location of the Entity in 3d space. There is GlobalTransform, which is the absolute position of the Entity relative to the origin (0, 0, 0). And the Transform, which is the position of the Entity relative to its parent (or the origin, if it has no parent.)\nThis is the coordinate space that our individual vertices will exist in.\nUV (Texture) Coordinates\nUV coordinates how flat textures are mapped onto the 3d surface of a mesh.\n\nWhat U and V actually are, are a 2d coordinate system (usually from 0.0 to 1.0, but can also be by raw pixel count in some engines/apis.) We will assign each of our vertexes in 3d space onto this 2d coordinate system, and then the relevant segment of the 2d texture will be projected on each triangle that we generated in the last tutorial. \nGeodetic Coordinates\nGeodetic Coordinates are a pair of angles that describe the location of an object on the surface of a sphere. \n\nIn reality, they aren't this simple. The objects we normally measure with Geodetic coordinates (such as earth) are not typically perfectly spherical. As a result of this (and computers), we have the wonderful field of GIS. (This has made a lot of software engineers very confused, and has been widely regarded as a bad move.) The variety of actual Geodetic systems, and their insanely large number of Datums (reference points from which spatial measurements are made) can make your head spin.\nHowever, you can go far in the field of GIS by pretending that earth is a sphere (which it definitely isn't) and pretending all datums are WGS84 (or better yet, convert them). 1 \nBut for this project, it doesn't matter. We aren't optimizing for 10m accuracy, we just want a pretty earth.\nConverting from Cartesian to UV\nFortunately we have a somewhat direct method of converting between our Cartesian Coordinates and UV coordinates. In this example, we are going to use Geodetic Coordinates as a translation between them. \nKnowing that Positive longitudes are east of the Prime Meridian, negative west of the Prime Meridian, and Positive and Negative latitudes are north and south of the equator respectively, we can flatten these onto a 2d map with values that look like this:\n       -180 (W)                   0                     180 (E)\n        ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n +90 (N)│                                                │\n        │                                                │\n        │                                                │\n        │                                                │\n        │                                                │\n  0     │                                                │\n        │                                                │\n        │                                                │\n        │                                                │\n        │                                                │\n -90 (S)└────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n\nWhich is more or less how Mercator projection works.\nAll we need to do to convert a latitude/longitude pair to a position on our UV map. To do so, need to map the latitude and longitude from their normal ranges to 0.0 -&gt; 1.0. Which is accomplished by this pair of functions:\nfn map_latitude(lat: f32) -&gt; Result&lt;f32, CoordError&gt; {\n    // 90 -&gt; 0 maps to 0.0 to 0.5\n    // 0 -&gt; -90 maps to 0.5 to 1.0\n    // Ensure latitude is valid\n    if !(-90.0..=90.0).contains(&amp;lat) {\n        return Err(CoordError {\n            msg: \"Invalid latitude: {lat:?}\".to_string(),\n        });\n    }\n    if (90.0..=0.0).contains(&amp;lat) {\n        Ok(map((90.0, 0.0), (0.0, 0.5), lat))\n    } else {\n        Ok(map((0.0, -90.0), (0.5, 1.0), lat))\n    }\n}\n\nfn map_longitude(lon: f32) -&gt; Result&lt;f32, CoordError&gt; {\n    // -180 -&gt; 0 maps to 0.0 to 0.5\n    // 0 -&gt; 180 maps to 0.5 to 1.0\n    //Ensure longitude is valid\n    if !(-180.0..=180.0).contains(&amp;lon) {\n        return Err(CoordError {\n            msg: \"Invalid longitude: {lon:?}\".to_string(),\n        });\n    }\n    if (-180.0..=0.0).contains(&amp;lon) {\n        Ok(map((-180.0, 0.0), (0.0, 0.5), lon))\n    } else {\n        Ok(map((0.0, 180.0), (0.5, 1.0), lon))\n    }\n}\n\nNow, the last piece we need to make this coordinate conversion work is the ability to convert Cartesian Coordinates (x, y, z) to Geodetic ones (lat, lon). Assuming the point is normalized, getting these two angles is not difficult.\nFor latitude, we need to take the arcsine of the point of our \"up\" axis, which in bevy is positive Y. For longitude, we need the arctangent of our two \"horizontal\" axes, X and Z. In rust, that looks like:\nlet latitude = normalized_point.y.asin();\nlet longitude = normalized_point.x.atan2(normalized_point.z);\n\nThis quite easily gets our latitude and longitude in radians. Note that this strategy only works if the GlobalTransform of the sphere is precisely at the origin (0, 0, 0) of our scene. If you want this \nto work on spheres not at the origin of the scene (or for multiple different spheres) there will be a few extra steps involved.\nI also want some easy ways to convert to degrees, since latitude and longitude aren't typically represented as radians. Fortunately this conversion is simple and not terribly lossy, so lets package all of this (as well as a few helper methods) up into a struct:\n#[derive(Debug)]\npub struct Coordinates {\n    // Stored internally in radians\n    pub latitude: f32,\n    pub longitude: f32,\n}\n\nimpl From&lt;Vec3&gt; for Coordinates {\n    fn from(value: Vec3) -&gt; Self {\n        let normalized_point = value.normalize();\n        let latitude = normalized_point.y.asin();\n        let longitude = normalized_point.x.atan2(normalized_point.z);\n        Coordinates {\n            latitude,\n            longitude,\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nimpl Coordinates {\n    pub fn as_degrees(&amp;self) -&gt; (f32, f32) {\n        let latitude = self.latitude * (180.0 / PI);\n        let longitude = self.longitude * (180.0 / PI);\n        (latitude, longitude)\n    }\n\n    pub fn convert_to_uv_mercator(&amp;self) -&gt; (f32, f32) {\n        let (lat, lon) = self.as_degrees();\n        let v = map_latitude(lat).unwrap();\n        let u = map_longitude(lon).unwrap();\n        (u, v)\n    }\n\n    #[allow(dead_code)]\n    pub fn from_degrees(latitude: f32, longitude: f32) -&gt; Result&lt;Self, CoordError&gt; {\n        if !(-90.0..=90.0).contains(&amp;latitude) {\n            return Err(CoordError {\n                msg: \"Invalid latitude: {lat:?}\".to_string(),\n            });\n        }\n        if !(-180.0..=180.0).contains(&amp;longitude) {\n            return Err(CoordError {\n                msg: \"Invalid longitude: {lon:?}\".to_string(),\n            });\n        }\n        let latitude = latitude / (180.0 / PI);\n        let longitude = longitude / (180.0 / PI);\n        Ok(Coordinates {\n            latitude,\n            longitude,\n        })\n    }\n\n    pub fn get_point_on_sphere(&amp;self) -&gt; Vec3 {\n        let y = self.latitude.sin();\n        let r = self.latitude.cos();\n        let x = self.longitude.sin() * -r;\n        let z = self.longitude.cos() * r;\n        Vec3::new(x, y, z).normalize() * EARTH_RADIUS\n    }\n}\n\nYou might also notice that the convert_to_uv_mercator method calls the mapping functions we made earlier, allowing us to convert between latlon and UV just by calling this method on a point.\nIn addition, we have a method get_point_on_sphere:\npub fn get_point_on_sphere(&amp;self) -&gt; Vec3 {\n    let y = self.latitude.sin();\n    let r = self.latitude.cos();\n    let x = self.longitude.sin() * -r;\n    let z = self.longitude.cos() * r;\n    Vec3::new(x, y, z).normalize() * EARTH_RADIUS\n}\n\nThis allows us to convert in the other direction, and get a point on the sphere from Geodetic coordinates. This would be useful if you want to spawn an object at a given latlon.\nSetting UV Coordinates\nNow that we have a means to get a UV coordinate for each vertex in our mesh, we need to actually assign them. So lets take a look at a new version of our generate_face function:\npub fn generate_face(\n    normal: Vec3,\n    resolution: u32,\n    x_offset: f32,\n    y_offset: f32,\n) -&gt; Mesh {\n    let axis_a = Vec3::new(normal.y, normal.z, normal.x); // Horizontal\n    let axis_b = axis_a.cross(normal); // Vertical\n    let mut verticies: Vec&lt;Vec3&gt; = Vec::new();\n\n// Create a new vec containing our uv coords\n    let mut uvs = Vec::new();\n\t\n    let mut indicies: Vec&lt;u32&gt; = Vec::new();\n    let mut normals = Vec::new();\n    let mut first_longitude = 0.0;\n    for y in 0..(resolution) {\n        for x in 0..(resolution) {\n            let i = x + y * resolution;\n\n            let percent = Vec2::new(x as f32, y as f32) / (resolution - 1) as f32;\n            let point_on_unit_cube =\n                normal + (percent.x - x_offset) * axis_a + (percent.y - y_offset) * axis_b;\n\t// Convert our point_coords into `Coordinates`\n            let point_coords: Coordinates = point_on_unit_cube.normalize().into();\n            let normalized_point = point_on_unit_cube.normalize() * EARTH_RADIUS;\n            verticies.push(normalized_point);\n\t// Get the UV Coordinates of our point\n            let (mut u, mut v) = point_coords.convert_to_uv_mercator();\n\n\t// Some special case logic\n            if y == 0 &amp;&amp; x == 0 {\n                first_longitude = lon;\n            }\n\t// In the middle latitudes, if we start on a \n\t// negative longitude but then wind up crossing to a \n\t// positive longitude, set u to 0.0 to prevent a seam\n            if first_longitude &lt; 0.0 &amp;&amp; lon &gt; 0.0 &amp;&amp; lat &lt; 89.0 &amp;&amp; lat &gt; -89.0 {\n                u = 0.0;\n            }\n\t// If we are below -40 degrees latitude and the tile \n\t// starts at 180 degrees, set u to 0.0 to prevent a seam\n            if x == 0 &amp;&amp; lon == 180.0 &amp;&amp; lat &lt; -40.0 {\n                u = 0.0;\n            }\n\t// Push the UV Coordinates into the vec\n            uvs.push([u, v]);\n            normals.push(-point_on_unit_cube.normalize());\n\n            if x != resolution - 1 &amp;&amp; y != resolution - 1 {\n                // First triangle\n                indicies.push(i);\n                indicies.push(i + resolution);\n                indicies.push(i + resolution + 1);\n\n                // Second triangle\n                indicies.push(i);\n                indicies.push(i + resolution + 1);\n                indicies.push(i + 1);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    let indicies = mesh::Indices::U32(indicies);\n    let mut mesh = Mesh::new(PrimitiveTopology::TriangleList);\n    mesh.set_indices(Some(indicies));\n    mesh.insert_attribute(Mesh::ATTRIBUTE_POSITION, verticies);\n    mesh.insert_attribute(Mesh::ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL, normals);\n\t// Insert the UV attribute along with our uv vec\n    mesh.insert_attribute(Mesh::ATTRIBUTE_UV_0, uvs);\n    mesh.generate_tangents().unwrap();\n    mesh\n}\n\nYou are probably wondering what is up with this bit specifically:\n\t// Some special case logic\n            if y == 0 &amp;&amp; x == 0 {\n                first_longitude = lon;\n            }\n\t// In the middle latitudes, if we start on a \n\t// negative longitude but then wind up crossing to a \n\t// positive longitude, set u to 0.0 to prevent a seam\n            if first_longitude &lt; 0.0 &amp;&amp; lon &gt; 0.0 &amp;&amp; lat &lt; 89.0 &amp;&amp; lat &gt; -89.0 {\n                u = 0.0;\n            }\n\t// If we are below -40 degrees latitude and the tile \n\t// starts at 180 degrees, set u to 0.0 to prevent a seam\n            if x == 0 &amp;&amp; lon == 180.0 &amp;&amp; lat &lt; -40.0 {\n                u = 0.0;\n            }\n\nThis is a section that is needed to prevent seams where the UV coordinates go in the wrong direction. Since the coordinates near the prime meridian go from \n1 to 0 in the space of one vertex, the entire texture is re-projected backwards on the faces leading up to the prime meridian. There are a few ways to fix this, namely offsetting\nyour vertexes so that they are exactly aligned with the prime meridian, but I decided to just clamp the values close to both the prime meridian and the poles to prevent the seams from occurring.\nAnd, just to test that everything is working properly, lets go ahead and assign it an uv test texture of your choice.\npub fn generate_faces(\n    mut commands: Commands,\n    mut meshes: ResMut&lt;Assets&lt;Mesh&gt;&gt;,\n    mut materials: ResMut&lt;Assets&lt;StandardMaterial&gt;&gt;,\n    asset_server: Res&lt;AssetServer&gt;,\n) {\n    let faces = vec![\n        Vec3::X,\n        Vec3::NEG_X,\n        Vec3::Y,\n        Vec3::NEG_Y,\n        Vec3::Z,\n        Vec3::NEG_Z,\n    ];\n\n    let offsets = vec![(0.0, 0.0), (0.0, 1.0), (1.0, 0.0), (1.0, 1.0)];\n\n    let mut rng = rand::thread_rng();\n\n    for direction in faces {\n        for offset in &amp;offsets {\n            commands.spawn((\n                PbrBundle {\n                    mesh: meshes.add(generate_face(direction, 100, offset.0, offset.1)),\n                    material: materials.add(StandardMaterial {\n                        base_color_texture: Some(\n                            asset_server.load(\"WorldTextures/uv_test_texture.png\"),\n                        ),\n                        ..default()\n                    }),\n                    ..default()\n                },\n                PickableBundle::default(), // Makes the entity pickable\n                RaycastPickTarget::default(),\n                On::&lt;Pointer&lt;Click&gt;&gt;::run(|event: Listener&lt;Pointer&lt;Click&gt;&gt;| {\n                    info!(\"Clicked on entity {:?}\", event);\n                    let hit = event.hit;\n                    if let Some(pos) = hit.position {\n                        let coords: Coordinates = pos.into();\n                        let (latitude, longitude) = coords.as_degrees();\n                        info!(\n                            \"Latlon of selected point: Lat: {}, Lon: {}\",\n                            latitude, longitude\n                        );\n                    }\n                }),\n            ));\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nWhile we were messing with that function, I also used the wonderful bevy picking module to give us a chance to look at/debug our coordinate generation if it isn't working correctly. Now when you click on the sphere, you should get a log message emitted with the latitude and longitude coordinates.\nSo, lets fire it up and see what happens:\n\n\n\nWhich looks pretty good!\nAnd when you click on the globe, you get this lovely log message:\n2023-10-20T19:14:05.861205Z  INFO surface_action::map: Latlon of selected point: Lat: 29.734213, Lon: -95.40474\n\nSo now that all of that is out of the way, lets make it look like an actual earth.\nTextures\nHead over to Visible Earth and download the texture package for the month of your choice. Use the highest resolution one if possible for maximum pretty. But if you get a WGPU error when compiling, try a lower resolution (you may also have to resample them in GIMP or another program if you are running on a computer without a discrete GPU.)\nIt should look something like this:\n\nNext, we will add a metallic roughness texture. This may be a bit confusing, because we aren't creating a metallic object, but we are going to use this channel to differentiate between the reflectivity of land versus the ocean. As a result, I've taken one of NASAs specular maps and inverted it (you can download and invert it yourself from NASAs website, or just save the image below):\n\nAnd finally for our normal channel, we have a 21k resolution topography map.\n\nSince these images all use the same projection, the same UV coordinates will suffice for all of them. As a result, the only thing left to do is add them to our PBR material in the generate_faces function:\nPbrBundle {\n\tmesh: meshes.add(generate_face(direction, 800, offset.0, offset.1, &amp;rs)),\n\tmaterial: materials.add(StandardMaterial {\n\t\tbase_color_texture: Some(\n\t\t\tasset_server.load(\"WorldTextures/world_shaded_32k.png\"),\n\t\t),\n\t\tmetallic_roughness_texture: Some(\n\t\t\tasset_server.load(\"WorldTextures/specular_map_inverted_8k.png\"),\n\t\t),\n\t\tperceptual_roughness: 1.0,\n\t\tnormal_map_texture: Some(\n\t\t\tasset_server.load(\"WorldTextures/topography_21K.png\"),\n\t\t),\n\t\t..default()\n\t}),\n\t..default()\n},\n\nAnd the results should be a textured Earth:\n\n\n\nNext time we are going to use some GIS real world elevation data to deform the mesh into an exaggerated height model of the earth.\n1\nPlease don't actually do this if you are going into a GIS career though.\n\n","id":"https://blog.graysonhead.net/posts/bevy-proc-earth-2/","title":"Bevy Procedural Earth Part 2: Coordinate Systems and Materials"},"https://blog.graysonhead.net/posts/bevy-proc-earth-3/":{"body":"\nThe main goal of this project for me wasn't primarily about game development, but rather just to have a re-usable way to do global visualizations. One of the most interesting things to visualize on a planet is elevation. So in this tutorial we will look at actually displacing vertices in order to give our sphere some depth. This approach utilizes the high vertex count we generated in previous examples to create meaningful terrain detail.\nIn addition, I'll give an example of how you might use this program to visualize non-elevation data.\nElevation Dataset\nI'm using the ETOPO surface elevation models from NOAA in GeoTIFF format at a 60 arcsecond resolution. 60 arcseconds (approximately 1.1 miles at Earth's average surface elevation) is perfectly adequate for what we are doing here. Working with raster files is also nice, because (as discussed in the previous post in this series) we can easily map Latitudes and Longitudes onto the (X, Y) coordinates of our raster using affine transforms (which almost all GIS libraries support).\nReading Data From The Raster\nThe core functionality is implemented in this struct::\npub struct RasterData {\n    pub dataset: Dataset,\n    pub transform: CoordTransform,\n}\n\nimpl RasterData {\n    pub fn new(path: &amp;str) -&gt; Result&lt;Self, GdalError&gt; {\n        let dataset = Dataset::open(path)?;\n        let srs = dataset.spatial_ref()?;\n        let target_srs = SpatialRef::from_epsg(4326)?;\n        let transform = gdal::spatial_ref::CoordTransform::new(&amp;srs, &amp;target_srs)?;\n        Ok(Self { dataset, transform })\n    }\n    // Takes a latitude and longitude in WGS84 coordinates (EPSG:4326) and returns the elevation at that point\n    pub fn get_coordinate_height(\n        &amp;self,\n        latitude: f64,\n        longitude: f64,\n    ) -&gt; Result&lt;Option&lt;f64&gt;, GdalError&gt; {\n        // Copy the input coordinates\n        let (lat, lon) = (latitude, longitude);\n        \n        // Transform the coordinates from everyone's favorite datum (WGS84) to the raster's native coordinate system\n        self.transform\n            .transform_coords(&amp;mut [lon], &amp;mut [lat], &amp;mut [])?;\n        \n        // Get the first raster band (usually the only one for elevation data)\n        let raster_band = self.dataset.rasterband(1)?;\n        \n        // Get the affine transformation parameters that map between pixel/line coordinates and georeferenced coordinates\n        let transform = self.dataset.geo_transform().unwrap();\n        \n        // Calculate the pixel (x) and line (y) coordinates in the raster using the affine transform\n        // transform[0] = top left x coordinate (origin)\n        // transform[1] = pixel width (x resolution)\n        // transform[3] = top left y coordinate (origin)\n        // transform[5] = pixel height (y resolution, typically negative as y decreases going down)\n        let x = (lon - transform[0]) / transform[1];\n        let y = (lat - transform[3]) / transform[5];\n        \n        // Read the elevation value at the calculated pixel position\n        // - Reads a 1x1 window at position (x,y)\n        // - Uses the Average resampling algorithm (which doesn't matter much for a 1x1 window)\n        // - Returns the data as f64 (double precision floating point)\n        let mut res_buffer = raster_band.read_as::&lt;f64&gt;(\n            (x as isize, y as isize),  // Pixel position (cast to integer)\n            (1, 1),                    // Window size to read (1x1 pixel)\n            (1, 1),                    // Output buffer size\n            Some(ResampleAlg::Average),// Resampling algorithm\n        )?;\n        \n        // Return the elevation value (or None if no data is found)\n        // pop() returns and removes the last element from res_buffer.data\n        Ok(res_buffer.data.pop())\n    }\n}\n\nHere's an example demonstrating how to use this functionality to retrieve elevation data:\n#[test]\nfn test_raster_map() {\n    let raster_data =\n        RasterData::new(\"assets/Bathymetry/gebco_2023_n47.7905_s39.9243_w25.6311_e42.9895.tif\")\n            .unwrap();\n\n    // Mt Elbrus\n    let tgt_latitude = 43.351851;\n    let tgt_longitude = 42.4368771;\n\n    let elevation = raster_data\n        .get_coordinate_height(tgt_latitude, tgt_longitude)\n        .unwrap()\n        .unwrap();\n\n    assert_eq!(elevation, 5392.0);\n}\n\nAnd that is basically all there is to extracting data from a raster. If you want to be more precise, it might be useful to calculate the average area represented by each vertex and sample a larger size, averaging the result (which you can adjust by changing the window size) or using a different resampling technique. But since our goal isn't to create ultra-accurate maps I think this should be good enough.\nMoving Pixels\nNow, I first want to say, this is an extremely unoptimized naive way to do this. If I had more time to dedicate to this little experiment, I would probably split the rendering of each tile (since we constructed our sphere from multiple distinct Entities) into multiple systems so it can generate the offsets in paralell. But perfect is the enemy of done, so here is something that at least works. \nModifying our pre-existing generate_face function, we can accomplish what we need to do with two additional lines:\npub fn generate_face(\n    normal: Vec3,\n    resolution: u32,\n    x_offset: f32,\n    y_offset: f32,\n    rs: &amp;RasterData,\n) -&gt; Mesh {\n    let axis_a = Vec3::new(normal.y, normal.z, normal.x); // Horizontal\n    let axis_b = axis_a.cross(normal); // Vertical\n\n    // Create a vec of verticies and indicies\n    let mut verticies: Vec&lt;Vec3&gt; = Vec::new();\n    let mut uvs = Vec::new();\n    let mut indicies: Vec&lt;u32&gt; = Vec::new();\n    let mut normals = Vec::new();\n    let mut first_longitude = 0.0;\n    for y in 0..(resolution) {\n        for x in 0..(resolution) {\n            let i = x + y * resolution;\n\n            let percent = Vec2::new(x as f32, y as f32) / (resolution - 1) as f32;\n            let point_on_unit_cube =\n                normal + (percent.x - x_offset) * axis_a + (percent.y - y_offset) * axis_b;\n            let point_coords: Coordinates = point_on_unit_cube.normalize().into();\n            let (lat, lon) = point_coords.as_degrees();\n            // Get the height value at the geographic coordinates\n            let height_offset = rs.get_coordinate_height(lat as f64, lon as f64);\n            // Add the elevation to the earth_radius value of the normalized point\n            let normalized_point = if let Ok(Some(offset)) = height_offset {\n                let height = if offset &gt; 0.0 { offset / 1000.0 } else { 0.0 };\n                point_on_unit_cube.normalize() * (EARTH_RADIUS + (height) as f32)\n            } else {\n                point_on_unit_cube.normalize() * EARTH_RADIUS\n            };\n\n            verticies.push(normalized_point);\n            let (mut u, v) = point_coords.convert_to_uv_mercator();\n\n            if y == 0 &amp;&amp; x == 0 {\n                first_longitude = lon;\n            }\n            // In the middle latitudes, if we start on a negative longitude but then wind up crossing to a positive longitude, set u to 0.0 to prevent a seam\n            if first_longitude &lt; 0.0 &amp;&amp; lon &gt; 0.0 &amp;&amp; lat &lt; 89.0 &amp;&amp; lat &gt; -89.0 {\n                u = 0.0;\n            }\n            // If we are below -40 degrees latitude and the tile starts at 180 degrees, set u to 0.0 to prevent a seam\n            if x == 0 &amp;&amp; lon == 180.0 &amp;&amp; lat &lt; -40.0 {\n                u = 0.0;\n            }\n            uvs.push([u, v]);\n            normals.push(-point_on_unit_cube.normalize());\n\n            if x != resolution - 1 &amp;&amp; y != resolution - 1 {\n                // First triangle\n                indicies.push(i);\n                indicies.push(i + resolution);\n                indicies.push(i + resolution + 1);\n\n                // Second triangle\n                indicies.push(i);\n                indicies.push(i + resolution + 1);\n                indicies.push(i + 1);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    let indicies = mesh::Indices::U32(indicies);\n    let mut mesh = Mesh::new(PrimitiveTopology::TriangleList);\n    mesh.set_indices(Some(indicies));\n    mesh.insert_attribute(Mesh::ATTRIBUTE_POSITION, verticies);\n    mesh.insert_attribute(Mesh::ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL, normals);\n    mesh.insert_attribute(Mesh::ATTRIBUTE_UV_0, uvs);\n    mesh.generate_tangents().unwrap();\n    mesh\n}\n\nSpecifically, the lines we added:\n// Get the height value at the geographic coordinates\nlvet height_offset = rs.get_coordinate_height(lat as f64, lon as f64);\n// Add the elevation to the earth_radius value of the normalized point\nlet normalized_point = if let Ok(Some(offset)) = height_offset {\n    let height = if offset &gt; 0.0 { offset / 1000.0 } else { 0.0 };\n    point_on_unit_cube.normalize() * (EARTH_RADIUS + (height) as f32)\n} else {\n    point_on_unit_cube.normalize() * EARTH_RADIUS\n};\n\nAs you can see, this is pretty simple since it just builds off of what we already have. You can change the number that divides the offset to adjust how exaggerated the values are. If EARTH_RADIUS is the radius of the earth in meters, a value of 1.0 should give you a perfectly proportional earth. Of course, you won't move each vertex much at all at that point, and with the number of vertices in the sphere, you wouldn't be able to see anything anyways.\n\nVisualizing Other Data\nAssuming you want to visualize using new entities, you can easily do so as long as you have a value you want to base the color/shape/size of the new entity on, and the latitude and longitude of the datapoint by converting the LatLon to a Vec3 of a point on the sphere. Here is the struct I use to do all my Geographic/Cartesian coordinate conversions for reference:\n#[derive(Debug)]\npub struct Coordinates {\n    // Stored internally in radians (because math)\n    pub latitude: f32,\n    pub longitude: f32,\n}\n\nimpl From&lt;Vec3&gt; for Coordinates {\n    fn from(value: Vec3) -&gt; Self {\n        let normalized_point = value.normalize();\n        let latitude = normalized_point.y.asin();\n        let longitude = normalized_point.x.atan2(normalized_point.z);\n        Coordinates {\n            latitude,\n            longitude,\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nimpl Coordinates {\n    pub fn as_degrees(&amp;self) -&gt; (f32, f32) {\n        let latitude = self.latitude * (180.0 / PI);\n        let longitude = self.longitude * (180.0 / PI);\n        (latitude, longitude)\n    }\n\n    pub fn convert_to_uv_mercator(&amp;self) -&gt; (f32, f32) {\n        let (lat, lon) = self.as_degrees();\n        let v = map_latitude(lat).unwrap();\n        let u = map_longitude(lon).unwrap();\n        (u, v)\n    }\n\n    #[allow(dead_code)]\n    pub fn from_degrees(latitude: f32, longitude: f32) -&gt; Result&lt;Self, CoordError&gt; {\n        if !(-90.0..=90.0).contains(&amp;latitude) {\n            return Err(CoordError {\n                msg: \"Invalid latitude: {lat:?}\".to_string(),\n            });\n        }\n        if !(-180.0..=180.0).contains(&amp;longitude) {\n            return Err(CoordError {\n                msg: \"Invalid longitude: {lon:?}\".to_string(),\n            });\n        }\n        let latitude = latitude / (180.0 / PI);\n        let longitude = longitude / (180.0 / PI);\n        Ok(Coordinates {\n            latitude,\n            longitude,\n        })\n    }\n\n    pub fn get_point_on_sphere(&amp;self) -&gt; Vec3 {\n        let y = self.latitude.sin();\n        let r = self.latitude.cos();\n        let x = self.longitude.sin() * r;\n        let z = self.longitude.cos() * r;\n        Vec3::new(x, y, z).normalize() * EARTH_RADIUS\n    }\n}\n\nSo if we wanted to visualize cities with a population over 1 million as spheres, colored and sized based on total population, we could implement a system like this:\nfn spawn_city_population_spheres(\n    mut commands: Commands,\n    mut meshes: ResMut&lt;Assets&lt;Mesh&gt;&gt;,\n    mut materials: ResMut&lt;Assets&lt;StandardMaterial&gt;&gt;,\n) {\n    // Cities data: (name, latitude, longitude, population in millions)\n    let major_cities: Vec&lt;(String, f32, f32, f32)&gt;

I'd like to eventually make this a bit more general and re-usable. Perhaps releasing it as a library or as a WASM app in the future. Building this was an incredible learning experience though. I was a complete newbie to GIS concepts before this. And knowing how to read from Geographic raster files is an incredibly useful thing that can be utilized in lots of different software engineering domains.\n","id":"https://blog.graysonhead.net/posts/bevy-proc-earth-3/","title":"Bevy Procedural Earth Part 3: Visualizations"},"https://blog.graysonhead.net/posts/greif/":{"body":"\nOn a school morning, my sister and I sat with our mother eating breakfast, as we did almost every day. We lived in a rather eccentric but somewhat laid back trailer park mixed located effectively in the middle of a somewhat normal suburban neighborhood. We had our fair share of drama, drug dealers, and domestic calls. Sirens weren’t at all uncommon despite a relatively high level of safety. But the sirens this morning were different. One of my career mentors later in life, a former chaplain for the local fire department, would later tell me that nothing motivates emergency services quite like a call from a desperate mother saying the words “my child isn’t breathing.”\nFirst there was one siren, then two, then what seemed like ten. Then there was Starflight, our local helicopter ambulance service. My mother offered a prayer for whomever was on the receiving end of all this attention, but otherwise we went on with our day. I remember not being able to focus in my classes, I remember wishing my best friend (and one of my only friends) was there. He had been sick for the last week with a stomach bug that was going around the school.\nI couldn’t tell you what day it was, nor could I tell you whether school had just started or was about to end. I couldn’t tell you what classes I was in, or who my teachers were. But I can describe in detail when our teacher led us into the cafeteria with the rest of the 5th grade after our lass class. They had the folding tables laid out as if lunch were about to be served; with one notable exception. On each table, sat two tissue boxes. These had clearly been laid out with some care, they were perfectly centered on the tables and evenly spaced. I was confused as I walked in, and I was confused as I sat down, and I was confused when the principal started speaking. I don’t even remember what he said, I just remember the gist; your friend is dead. But I do remember sitting in that room on a bench surrounded by my peers, feeling like an open wound in a pool of alcohol. It was devastatingly impersonal. After all this was my best friend in all of the world; and I found out just like everyone else. The jealous anger only lasted a few seconds though as a new emotion was emerging. A feeling like perpetual falling. I would later learn the word for this feeling, Grief.\nThere are some things in life you just don’t get over, and Grief is one of those things. Grief is also a feeling impossible to describe, especially to someone who hasn’t experienced it. The dictionary only makes a half-baked attempt at defining it, labeling it as “deep sorrow”. Grief eviscerated me so severely that I thought I would never be happy again. In fairness, it did take several years. I cried most of the days I went to school, and unfortunately while my former peers were rather sympathetic to my tears (they themselves having gone through the same experience) I was no longer at that school, and a lot of my new classmates had no frame of reference for what we had gone through, and the bullies didn’t care. I didn’t have many friends, and I got into several fights. Most of the time I didn’t bother to defend myself, because I didn’t see the point. “Why bother? Everyone you love is mortal, they could all die at any moment. So what exactly is the point of making more friends?” My 11 year old self reasoned. “Why try with anything?”\nEventually my parents did something about my downward spiral, and sent me to a wonderful private school. It was a fresh start. Thanks to an exorbitant quantity of counseling, I could at least get through a normal school day without loosing it, and I stood a chance at making some friends; which I did. And there I met a very special girl, and even got enough courage to ask her out.\nAfter I moved on to the next school I regressed somewhat. My childhood dog had died, and it was as if everything I fought so hard to repress burst out of me like a balloon. The scabs I had been building over the mental wounds of 4 years prior had been ripped off with impressive force. I got into fights again, my grades fell, and I dropped into depression again.\nIn the end, it turned out okay. I graduated, barely. I made some good friends, one of whom I still talk to and regard as one of my best friends. I helped make an online community that provided me with a good supply of long-distance friends that never made me feel judged or unwelcome. And, best of all, the aforementioned girl reconsidered my offer a few years later. We’ve been together for almost 11 years now. Together, we created a life that I love.\nI suffered more Grief after that. Some of my online friends were killed by a drunk driver. My grandmother died. And more recently, my wife and I experienced a miscarriage. It was never the same twice. And for certain, all of those paled in comparison to that first brush with Grief. But they still sent me dropping into the slick ditch that seems impossible to climb out of.\nI became desperate to understand what the purpose of Grief was in my life.\nI read on the internet somewhere that Grief is like waves. The first ones are 100ft tall and 10 seconds apart, but eventually they come farther and farther apart. They still sweep you off of your feet, but you can see the coming. You know what the triggers of Grief are. And then they get shorter, instead of being 100 feet, they might be 20 feet. I started thinking about how tall the waves were and at what frequency they occurred during my life. In the case of my friend, they were 100 feet high and came at least once or twice a week for the first two years. After that, they came around twice a month. I think the first time one of the waves hit me and failed to bring any tears was my Junior year of high school.\nThe other losses in my life have followed the same pattern, but they usually had shorter waves to begin with, and the frequency was much lower. As if I was starting in year three after the initial event. I thought that further losses would get easier, but that didn’t seem to be the case. Each pain had its own distinct flavor, and strangely the waves didn’t seem to ever coincide. Some were above average, and some less so. But they all followed the same pattern. A wave, the normalcy, then another wave.\nMy son was born on July 17th. The pregnancy was normal, the birth was normal, and despite a small scare at the start (he was to stubborn to cry, which concerned the nurse) he had no medical issues to speak of if you overlooked his bruised and misshapen head (even the perfect birth is still traumatic.) As the nurses tended to my wife, I sat with him on the rather spartan couch that had caused me so much ire over the previous 24 hours (a block of concrete would have been more comfortable). I looked at his face, and his eyes were looking deep into mine. I was overwhelmed by a sense of Joy that was indescribable. That joy never left me. I still feel it to this day. My family makes me so immensely happy that my sides often feel like they might burst.\nA few months later, I looked at my son as I was feeding him a bottle, and I saw my friend looking back at me. At first, I was confused. Then I was scared as the realization that I brought my son into a dangerous and unpredictable world hit me. But I was also strangely comforted. It was a mixture of melancholy and contentedness. At this moment, I realized what the purpose of Grief was in my life.\nYou can’t truly appreciate joy until you’ve experienced despair.\nGrief is the black in a monochrome image. Without the contrast, you don’t properly appreciate the beauty. The more sadness and darkness in your life, the more that joy and happiness are brought into relief. It takes knowing the acidic taste of a lemon to appreciate the sweetness of a strawberry.\nIf I have anything to thank those who have departed from my life for, its that I don’t take much for granted. Often times I’ll be tired after a long day at work, and my toddler will be getting into something he isn’t supposed to for the 6th or 7th time; and as I’m on the verge of loosing my temper a little wave of Grief will hit me, and I’ll take a moment to appreciate what I have in my life.\nWhen I first felt the waves of Grief after my friend died, I never thought the waves would stop destroying me. I never thought I was going to be okay ever again.\nThe waves never did stop coming.\nBut, Nearly 15 years later, I feel like I’m standing ankle deep in the water of a lake. Occasionally, small waves no more than a few inches high will come up to the shore in batches of three or four. They are big enough that you notice them, but they cause no discomfort. They remind me of the 100ft tall tsunamis that destroyed me a decade ago, but they are also comforting. They reassure me that I wont forget the people who have departed from my life. They remind me of all the good memories I’ve had with them. And they remind me not to take the simplest things for granted. At this point, I don’t mind the waves. They bring me a sort of melancholic comfort. There will still be a big wave every now and then, but the water is calm enough that I’ll see it coming. I think the comfort comes from the fact that I know I have loved as deep as I possibly can, and tried to make the most of every singe day. When my time comes, I know I won’t have regrets. And, at least partially, I have Grief to thank for that.\nIf you are currently suffering from loss, just know one thing; It does get better. It takes a long time.

In some cases, you may still run into performance issues, in which case you should increase the profile.dev opt level, or alternatively just compile in release mode.\nSpeaking of which, nix build will always compile in release mode.\nNow, if you really want to get the compile times down, you will enable the dynamic_linking (formerly known as dynamic in pre 0.10 releases of Bevy). However, this prevents nix build or nix run from working, because dynamic linking in Nix is...odd. At least in regards to Rust.\nSo, to combat this, I made this rather counter-intuitive addition to the Cargo manifest:\n[dependencies]\nbevy = { package = \"bevy\", version = \"0.10.1\"}\n\n[features]\ndefault = [\"bevy/dynamic_linking\"]\n\nSo, by default if you run cargo build or cargo run, you will get very fast compile times thanks to dynamic linking, however once you build the derivation in release mode using nix, it won't use dynamic linking (and will actually work as a result.)\nThe cargoBuildOptions line in the flake governs that behavior:\npackages = rec {\n    bevy_template = naersk'.buildPackage {\n    src = ./.;\n    nativeBuildInputs = nativeBuildInputs;\n    buildInputs = buildInputs;\n    postInstall = ''\n        cp -r assets $out/bin/\n    '';\n    # Disables dynamic linking when building with Nix\n    cargoBuildOptions = x: x ++ [ \"--no-default-features\" ];\n    };\n};\n\nIn addition, the postInstall line ensures that any game assets are copied to the correct directory. \nSo, you get the best of both worlds more or less. Consistent development environments using Flakes, fast compile times using cargo, and statically linked outputs using nix.\nNon NixOS Systems\nIf you want to run this example using Nix on a non-NixOS system, you will need an extra step. Since your graphics drivers are most likely not available in the Nix store, you will need to employ a wrapper to make them available. \nThe best one I've found is NixGL. \nUse it like this:\nnix run --impure github:guibou/nixGL -- nix run\n\nOr, if your Nix install doesn't have Non-free packages enabled by default:\nexport NIXPKGS_ALLOW_UNFREE=1 &amp;&amp; nix run --impure github:guibou/nixGL -- nix run\n\n","id":"https://blog.graysonhead.net/posts/nix-flake-rust-bevy/","title":"Nix Powered Dev Environments: Rust + Bevy"},"https://blog.graysonhead.net/posts/nixos-hype/":{"body":"Sometimes something comes along that legitimately disrupts the software/IT industry. Some examples that come to mind are Ansible, Docker, Kubernetes, etc. But far more often, projects and products come along that make exaggerated claims of being revolutionary, only to die an unceremonious death.\nAt a certian point it becomes clear to everyone who the winners and the losers are. But by that time they are always so far along their journey of marketplace dominance that the job market is saturated by experts and anyone getting on board is on the laggard side of the adoption curve. \nOne thing is clear; Nix isn't there yet. But will it ever be? Is it worth your valuable time learning about it now?\nDisambiguating Nix\nIts important to make a distinction between Nix: the package manager, and NixOS: the linux distribution that uses the Nix package manager. And then, to make things extra confusing, you also have Nix: the domain specific language. I'll forgive you being confused because I'll be referring to the package manager and the language interchangeably. \nIn truth, it won't affect the conclusions of this post because what I want to evaluate the viability of the ecosystem of Nix, which includes all of the aforementioned components. How do these things all add up? Do they really make managing software and systems easier? Or is it just another useless layer of abstraction?\nThe Promise of Panacea\nLooking back to when I learned ansible, I remember being filled with its promise. I was still working for a company that largely managed servers like pets (because everyone did in those days except for the rare hyper-scale exceptions.) I remember thinking that Ansible was going to revolutionize the way I provisoined machines, and in all honesty it did. It solved a lot of problems, but more importantly, it changed my mindset on how large herds of computers should be managed.\nAnsible had a lot of shortcomings though, for instance, while it tried very hard to be declarative it was still very much operating on an imperative CLI or against imperative APIs. While most of the core plugins were idempotent (you can run them multiple times and it won't mess things up if the system is already in the correct state), there was no functional way of forcing plugin developers to write idempotent plugins. As a result, as you left the officially blessed core plugins, you entered a wild west where side effects and unexpected behavior were more and more likely. \nAnsible was a very important step in improving the way provisioning worked, but it wasn't a panacea. \nDocker was another huge step forward for the industry. It has very minimal scripts (Dockerfiles) that allow you to build an image that can be deployed on systems that contained their own environments. It solved a lot of traditional problems that came from running in the shared library environment of traditional Linux. It made traditionally hard-to-deploy applications much easier.\nBut this introduced a new class of problems. From tried and true build scripts to fragile Dockerfiles that were often vulnerable to bitrot. Additionally relying on a user defined label instead of a hash by default (don't even get me started on the latest tag) led to a lot of potential security issues, and performance problems and bugs that were difficult to debug (why are half of my application servers crashing when they are all running the same version?) Additionally IO and Network issues are commonplace, and vulnerability fixes (meltdown and spectre specifically) resulted in a lot of strange performance bugs inside of containers.\nDocker was another huge step, but again, far from a panacea.\nWhat Problems Does Nix Actually Solve?\nThe Nix ecosystem is capable of deterministically and repeatably building software, and entire operating systems (including their configuration). It puts guard rails (isolated sandboxes and source control) in place to ensure that the same inputs always deliver the same outputs. In short, the same inputs will always give you (bit for bit) the same output. \nWhy is this important?\nFirstly, it allows you to build software fearlessly. The same inputs will always produce the same outputs, so if you build something 10 different times on 10 different computers (assuming they run the same architecture), you get the same bit-for-bit result 10 times, even if you build the last one several years apart. This allows you to do fun things like building binaries, uploading them to a shared cache, and then transparently substituting the output when the input hash matches. This means your install process is identical to your build process, which gives you immense flexibility. You don't need a CI/CD pipeline to build artifacts and then worry about deploying those artifacts to your servers. You can absolutely have a CI/CD pipeline that warms up a cache so you don't build binaries on your application servers, but this is completely optional (you should still have one though, at least for tests.) \nSecondly, it allows you to deterministically build operating systems. If you deploy 10 different servers from the same source, you will get the exact same server with the exact same behavior 10 times. Even if you build them several years apart. This completely eliminates a lot of the problems associated with imperative management schemes (for example, deploying something imperatively on a OS and then deploying something on a slightly newer OS which can result in wildly different performance due to library or OS tuning differences.) In other words, if you fix a problem once, you have inherently fixed it everywhere without having to worry about how to idempotently deploy that fix. Every single time you rebuild the system to deploy a change, you get a brand new fresh operating system (or as Nix calls them, a generation.)\nPutting all this together, what it means is that you can have a single repository (or several interconnected ones) that completely describes your server and build environment. And if you need to rebuild your entire environment a year from now, you will get the exact same environment.\nAdditionally, there are other benefits as well which I'm glossing over, such as the ability to deterministically roll back to a previous state in the case of a failed upgrade, and having an immense amount of flexibility regarding your deployment style. Being able to push (deploy-rs) and pull (rebuild against a Nix Flake in a git repo) in the same repo without configuration changes makes for a very nice workflow of allowing rapid iteration while also being extremely scalable.\nI'd also like to stress that deterministically building entire operating systems without any kind of heavy handed image cloning is a novel thing. It hasn't really been done before, and it can't really be done without making some of the ground-up design choices that NixOS made (such as abandoning FHS in favor of the nix store.)\nWhat Price Do You Pay For The Upsides?\nI'm gonna spoil the conclusion, Nix isn't a panacea either.\nNix as a language can be a real drag. It isn't because it is designed badly. It solves a very specific set of problems, and as a result has a specific set of conventions that may not be obvious or ergonomic to even seasoned developers/operations folk. This is doubly true if they have never used a purely functional language before.\nTo compound these issues, Nix doesn't really lend itself to toy examples or programs. Its a language to describe configurations, so the only thing you really can do with it is make packages and operating systems. As a result, the minimal viable example for most things is as complex as building a package. The simpler examples don't really teach you anything, and the complexity ramp is quite drastic in many cases.\nThe last thing any software engineer wants is to be instructed to learn a language they don't care about, and most software engineers don't appear give two hoots about packaging. So twisting the arm of any reasonably large organization, especially one with multiple development teams, to start packaging with Nix is going to be quite difficult unless there are a lot of developers already inclined to explore it.\nThis is especially true for NixOS adoption specifically, because excluding strategies like running Docker images or VMs on a NixOS box, you need your software and all of its dependencies packaged in Nix in order to deploy and orchestrate things.\nI really can't overstate how big this hurdle is.\nWhat Is Missing?\nMy opinion is, there are three big things needed to bridge the gap:\nDocumentation\nThe state of Nix documentation is pretty bad.\nThe two main sources are the Nix Manual and the NixOS manual.\nThere is an ideal ratio of time spent writing code to time spent writing documentation. No one knows what it actually is, but most people intuitively know when it isn't followed. However in the case of Nix it isn't so clear. There is, in fact, a lot of documentation. Its just that most of it isn't easy to follow. The documentation reads extremely terse, almost like an RFC or standards document. It seems to assume that the reader already groks the theoretical models of Nix and are looking for specific information. \nFor a reference manual, this would be fine. But for a guide meant to introduce new users, its just going to make people feel stupid and by extension piss them off. It lacks any kind of narrative. It spends an awful lot of time describing how things work, and no time showing how it works. The lack of examples in what should be the first stop for new users is a huge problem. \nStandardized Practices\nOne of Nix's biggest strengths is its flexibility. You can do a lot of creative things with packaging and systems configuration that are straight up not possible in alternative systems. However, this has a huge drawback: A total lack of standardization between different users and organizations.\nFlakes have made some strides in resolving this. Having a standardized input and output set that can be consumed by other Flakes does make collaborative Nix usage a lot more predictable. But anything made before the advent of flakes has a bit of \"wild west\" feel to it; you never really know how it works until you go read the source.\nMinified Examples\nSearching for minified examples of how to do X is difficult when it comes to Nix. I'm honestly not sure why this is, but it is something that I've heard countless colleagues complain about. I myself have run into this dozens of time. How do you include a configuration module in a Flake? How do you change the source of an application using its overrides attribute? How do you combine the result of two build outputs? None of these things are hard in Nix, but figuring out how to do them in the first place is difficult. It usually requires stumbling around in the source code of Nixpkgs or random Flakes until you finally run into what you are trying to do and see how someone else did it. Very few examples exist alone in isolation. \nThe State of Modern Nix and Its Users\nNix has been around since 2003, which is ages in the technology world. This might lead a lot of people to believe that its missed the boat on mass adoption. However, my personal feelings is that before the advent of Nix Flakes, Nix was a novel concept with no practical use outside of a Hobbyist OS. \nFor the record Nix Flakes were introduced in 2021 as experimental, and have not yet been marked as stable. However, I think you'd be foolish to try and introduce Nix to a new organization without Flakes. Flakes make Nix composable, and a declaratively built operating system using deterministically constructed software composed from multiple federated repositories is the secret sauce of Nix as an ecosystem. It allows you to define your entire infrastructure in Git (which isn't novel), and be able to rebuild it over and over again and get the exact same results every time (which is novel.)\nSo, considering the relative new-ness of flakes, I'd say modern nix is still very much in the early adopter quadrant of the adoption curve, and it is far from dead in the water.\nWhile I give \"old\" Nix a lot of crap, Nixpkgs (the monorepo) has a ton of software in it. And it all stays pretty well up to date, at least all the less obscure stuff. You are not often going to run into the situation where a package available for Ubuntu or Centos isn't available in Nix. And since the build process for packages doesn't bit rot, keeping packages up to date is often a lot easier than it is with traditional distributions as the amount of work a maintainer needs to exert is far greatly reduced once the initial package is defined.\nFunctionally re-creating a basic server in Nix using common open source technologies is easy bordering on trivial, once you figure out the nixos-rebuild workflow. It doesn't require you to write much Nix at all. This is true up until the point where you start packaging your own software. At that point, you have to package your software (as well as any missing dependencies.) In organizations with lots of in-house software this can be a lot of work\nIs It Worth Using Now?\nI have firsthand knowledge of a few companies that either already adopted or are well on their way to adopting Nix as an ecosystem. All of them have encountered some of the problems listed above, and in most cases there does need to be some organic interest within the engineering organization to get efforts off of the ground. \nBut, with that being said, the benefits are clear. Package reproducibility and all of its many positive side effects seem to legitimately eliminate a large swathe of problems that relate to fragile build processes. Using Nix to replace your traditional build pipeline in my experience typically means that you get to trust it. Which isn't something I'd typically say of a more traditional pipeline, especially if Groovy scripts or Dockerfiles are involved. \nFurthermore, using Nix to manage your systems has the benefit of your systems being far more consistent than they could be with other deployment mechanisms. At least, not without investing far more effort than would be reasonable. And when you fix a problem, it typically stays fixed. \nIf Nix has a theme I imagine it is something along the lines of: \"investing a bit more effort in your up-front setup can save you a lot more effort chasing problems later\". For me, the answer is clear; the tradeoff is well worth it.\n","id":"https://blog.graysonhead.net/posts/nixos-hype/","title":"Is Nix Worth The Hype?"},"https://blog.graysonhead.net/posts/runcible/":{"body":"I’m probably better with systems than networks. I’ve got a decent grasp of Networking concepts, but I’ve not worked in large scale environments as a network engineer. I architect-ed the network for a few small (&lt;50 rack) datacenters that were adequate, played with a lot of Linux powered switches, and did a fair bit of edge design with BGP.\nOn the other hand, as a systems guy I’ve worked in two notable large scale environments at this point, both of which are in the top 500 website list globally according to Alexa (the website statistics service, not the lady-tube). As well as countless smaller, but still pretty large environments. In these environments, some kind of config management for physical infrastructure is absolutely not optional; and can be the difference between being able to scale or being crushed under your own weight. As a result, I’ve developed some strong opinions about configuration management from a user’s perspective.\nA while back, I found myself in the position to manage a network again after doing large-scale systems work for a bit, and came to a realization: Open source declarative network automation tools don’t exist.\nNow, I know you can use Ansible, Chef, Puppet, and Salt to do a lot of network automation. And I’ve used Ansible and Salt to manage a mixed Juniper/Cumulus environment on several occasions. But trust me when I say the tools aren’t designed to manage networks, they were adapted to it. And if you are a network engineer that hasn’t spent any time on the other side of the fence, you probably don’t know what you are missing out on.\nThe First Problem: Commonality (A Dependency for Dry Declarations)\nThe rule of DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) exists for your sanity, and also the longevity of your keyboard. Every programmer lives and dies by DRY. And good configuration management languages should embrace it as well.\nBut with existing tools, you don’t really get it. At least not for network hardware.\nAlmost all of the major config automation suites support some kind of hierarchical hash/dict deep merge. For those unfamiliar with the concept, it goes something like this.\nlayers:\n  - country\n  - statecountry:\n  - name: USA\n    national_bird: Bald Eagle\n    national_mammal: Bison\n    national_flower: Rose\n    national_tree: Oak Treestate:\n  - name: Texas\n    state_flower: BlueBonnet\n  - name: Utah\n    state_flower: Sego Lilydeep_merge(country.USA, state.Texas)\nnational_bird: Bald Eagle\nnational_mammal: Bison\nnational_flower: Rose\nnational_tree: Oak Tree\nstate_flower: BlueBonnetdeep_merge(country.USA, state.Utah)\nnational_bird: Bald Eagle\nnational_mammal: Bison\nnational_flower: Rose\nnational_tree: Oak Tree\nstate_flower: Sego Lily\n\nIf you didn’t have deep merge available, you would have to define each entry like this:\nitem1: \n state_name: Texas\n national_bird: Bald Eagle\n national_mammal: Bison\n national_flower: Rose\n national_tree: Oak Tree\n state_flower: BlueBonnet\n country_name: USAitem2:\n state_name: Utah\n national_bird: Bald Eagle\n national_mammal: Bison\n national_flower: Rose\n national_tree: Oak Tree\n state_flower: Sego Lily\n country_name: USA\n\nWe saved 2 lines of defining by having an inheritance structure, and you can probably tell that the more attributes we define at the country level, the more savings we have.\nMerging can save you a lot of pain and boilerplate, especially when you have different servers in different locations with different configurations, but they still share things in common (like what they do, and how the software gets installed.) For servers, the OS serves as an adequate abstraction layer to smooth out hardware differences.\nThe problem is, no one has the same kind of network hardware at the end of the day, and in a lot of cases you may not even be able to run the same kind of network operating system in two different datacenters, or often, in the same datacenter. If you have an extremely homogeneous environment, you might not notice this problem, but chances are better that you don’t. And even if you do now, you won’t in the future when you inevitably switch platforms.\nUsing Ansible as an example, lets look at two different configuration snippets:\nJuniper:- name: Configure interface in access mode\n  junos_l2_interface:\n    name: ge-0/0/1\n    description: interface-access\n    mode: access\n    access_vlan: 2\n    active: True\n    state: presentCumulus:- name: Add an access interface on swp1\n  nclu:\n    commands:\n      - add int swp1\n      - add int swp1 bridge access 2\n\nBoth of these configurations do the exact same thing, but as you can see, there is no commonality between them whatsoever. As a result, you can’t have an inheritance structure, which means any changes made to one environment have to be translated by a human and inserted into the other(s). This completely breaks the principle of inheritance.\nMoreover, there is no commonality between different types of network hardware (with Juniper being a partial exception to this). Your Cisco Routers and Palo Alto firewalls don’t benefit from the extensive and labeled VLAN dictionary that you use to drive your switch configurations, so you have to repeat information even more.\nThe Second Problem: Topology is a Thing\nTopology isn’t a very important concept in server automation. Things need to be grouped, and you definitely want to keep a few of your application nodes untouched as you upgrade the others. In a lot of cases, you can define a sort of dependency hierarchy, but this doesn’t quite cut it for a network. Networks are all about topology, and trying to pretend like it isn’t important when running automation is a path to ruin.\nTake the following simple topology:\n\nGroup 1 is the role core_switches, and Group 2 is the role rack_switches.\nAll configuration management suites will give you the option to do a rolling upgrade within a group, which has a high probability of not working in this example. If you are running your operations idempotently, it may not cause a problem, but if you are making a data-center-wide change to your network environment that requires a restart of interfaces; the random choices your automation will make in this case could shoot you in the foot.\nIf you allow it to run two concurrent applies, and it picks the two middlemost core switches, you’ve just split-brained your datacenter. Or, slightly less worse, it might do a simultaneous apply on both of the switches in a rack, taking the rack down.\nThe current way to fix this? Just only run against one device within a role at any given time. The problem with this? Some datacenters have a LOT of network devices, as there are only so many hours in the day…\nGood network automation tools need to be aware of concepts like adjacency, clustering link aggregation, and pathing. Otherwise you are stuck automating things at a snails pace, or performing dangerous actions.\nThe Third Problem: Bootstrapping\nLets assume you have a completely homogeneous environment, and you have managed to solve the topology problem mentioned above. If you wind up having to deploy 30 racks, what does your deployment workflow look like? For servers, there is generally a middleman (generally PXE based) that deals with the initial provisioning of a system, and getting it “up enough” into a state where provisioning can be taken over by another system. But many switch ecosystems don’t have this.\nWhat usually happens is that a network engineer will connect a serial cable to a switch, and manually configure it’s management interface to be reachable over SSH or another protocol, then your config management software takes over. More rarely, your ecosystem will support some kind of “phone home” DNS address that can be used to phone home to a server and fetch a configuration file. But for consultants working in smaller environments, this is a non-starter, as that infrastructure doesn’t exist yet (that is what they are in the process of creating.) Also, that infrastructure can’t exist until the network does, so it makes little sense for provisioning network devices.\nAll of this combines to make the process of bootstrapping switches specifically (but also a horde of other network devices) a royal pain, and often a more annoying task than provisioning a far greater number of servers.\nWhat is Runcible?\nRuncible is a Framework and Command Line Application written in python to provide a declarative abstraction layer for configuring network devices. Put simply, it takes a desired state of a set of network appliances (that the user specifies), compares it to the current state of those appliances, and then determines all of the commands that need to be run to correct the differences idempotently. Due to it’s preference for operating on the command-line by default (you can also write plugins that interact with REST APIs), you can utilize the same plugins to configure devices over SSH, Telnet, RS-232, or any text-based CLI.\nHow Does it Fix Those Problems?\nModular Interfaces\nNetwork devices generally need to comply with networking standards, and Runcible takes advantage of the resultant similarities and provides abstraction layers that can be re-used on multiple different platforms with minimal modification.\nAs an example, here is a Runcible switch definition for a Cumulus switch in YAML:\nmeta: # &lt;- Meta module\n  device:\n    ssh:\n      hostname: switch1.oob.domain.net\n      username: cumulus\n    default_management_protocol: ssh\n    driver: cumulus\nsystem: # &lt;- Module\n  hostname: switch1.inf.domain.net # &lt;- Attribute\ninterfaces: # &lt;- Module\n  - name: swp1 # &lt;- Sub-module /attribute\n    pvid: 22\n    bpduguard: False\n  - name: swp2\n    pvid: 23\n    bpduguard: True\n    portfast: True\n\nThis example defines three modules, meta, system, and interfaces. Meta is a special module that contains configuration information, and also selects the driver; which is cumulus in this case. The other modules provide an interface to declare the desired state of certain aspects of the switch.\nIn the system module, we are defining a single attribute; hostname. This controls the hostname of the switch. In the interfaces module, we are defining two sub-modules of the interface type, swp1 and swp2. Inside of these sub-modules, attributes are defined that define the behavior for the individual switchports on the system.\nThe advantage to these interfaces, is that they are as generic as possible. They try to conform to the standards that each network device follows, not to the language and naming schemes of the individual network device platforms themselves. Each plugin and provider (we will get to those later) can provide their own modules; but they should consume the default ones when possible. This allows the same definition to be applicable to multiple types of network devices of a similar class. In theory, if a switch from “vendor A” supports the same modules as a switch from “vendor B”, their definition files can be completely interchangeable.\nLets look at a practical example of this:\nfrom runcible.api import Device\n\nvlans = {\n    \"vlans\": [\n        {\"name\": \"Employee Vlan\", \"id\": 20},\n        {\"name\": \"Super Secret Secure Vlan\", \"id\": 4000}\n    ]\n}\n\ninterface_template = {\n    \"interfaces\": [\n            {\"name\": \"swp1\", \"pvid\": 22, \"bpduguard\": False},\n            {\"name\": \"swp2\", \"pvid\": 23, \"bpduguard\": True}\n        ]\n}\n\nswitch_1 = {\n    \"meta\": {\n        \"device\": {\n            \"ssh\":{\n                \"hostname\": \"192.168.1.1\",\n            }\n        },\n        \"default_management_protocol\": \"ssh\",\n        \"driver\": \"vendor-a\"\n    },\n    \"system\": {\n        \"hostname\": \"switch1\"\n    }\n}\n\nswitch_2 = {\n    \"meta\": {\n        \"device\": {\n            \"ssh\":{\n                \"hostname\": \"192.168.1.2\",\n            }\n        },\n        \"default_management_protocol\": \"ssh\",\n        \"driver\": \"vendor-b\"\n    },\n    \"system\": {\n        \"hostname\": \"switch2\"\n    }\n}\n\nfor configuration in [switch_1, switch_2]:\n    configuration.update(vlans)\n    configuration.update(interface_template)\n    device = Device(configuration[\"system\"][\"hostname\"], configuration)\n    device.plan()\n    device.execute()\n\nAs you can see, we have two different devices with two different drivers that support the system, interfaces, and vlans module. Assuming you have a valid plugin for both “vendor-a” and “vendor-b”, you will get effectively the same configuration on both switches (aside from the hostname in this example.)\nIntuitively, adding another vlan to the “vlans” list will add it to both of the switches that merge that part of the configuration.\nIf you aren’t a Python developer, don’t worry. Later versions of Runcible with a more complete CLI component will abstract this behavior into a JSON directory structure. No code required.\nTopology Aware Schedulers\nOne of the priorities of Runcible in regards to topology discovery, is flexibility. Many devices support discovery protocols such as LLDP and CDP, some vendors offer proprietary methods of discovery, many users will want to define the topology manually, and some will be fine with grouping. A lot of people (especially consultants working in a large number of smaller networks) are probably fine with a naive scheduler that runs on one device at a time until they are all done.\nAs for the decisions that are informed by the topology, that remains to be seen somewhat. Again, the focus will be on flexibility. For many changes, it would be better to have a core -&gt; out run order, for others an edge -&gt; core run order. For less fancy operations, it would probably be fine to determine the run order by choosing devices with the least adjacent runs, or just ensure that only one cluster member at a time is being operated on for highly available devices.\nBut this will also be one of the final steps in a 1.0 release. The focus for now is a bottom to top implementation of the API functions, meaning that the device API will be more or less complete before the scheduler API is ready, and then a CLI application to wrap all of those will follow.\nOperating on the CLI (Or Whatever, Really)\nBy default, Runcible operates on devices using CLI commands. While this might seem a bit backwards in the {currentyear} REST JSONAPI fervor, it actually has a lot of wonderful side effects. Firstly, any text-based terminal will suffice for configuration. This means that when you go to the datacenter to deploy some switches, you just bring your laptop and clone your definition files locally. Then just plug your serial cable into a switch, and hit go.\nIts a simple concept, but very powerful.\nSo, When Can I Get It?\nRight now, this is a project I’m working on in my spare time, so it might be a while. But I’ve been working on solving this problem for a while now, and I don’t have any intention of stopping. I also welcome contributors, so if you want to bring this about faster; be the change you seek in the world!\nI Want to Help!\nGreat! I look forward to working with you!\nThe best place to get started is here: https://runcible.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contribution_guide.html\nRight now you won’t find much, and I haven’t posted any issues on GitHub yet, as the internal class structure is still somewhat in flux. Over the few months I’m hoping to get two somewhat feature complete plugins written for Cumulus and Unifi switches. Once these are complete I will begin a big documentation push in an effort to make the project more friendly to new contributors. Around then, I’ll make an announcement that it is “safe” to make pull requests (when the Plugin structure is stable); but until then any PRs submitted have a high chance of being refactored.\nOne thing that would be appreciated immediately is installing Runcible, and interacting with the API classes. Let me know how things work out, and how you think the output/public methods should be tweaked for usability and clarity.\nI’m also more than happy to take old network equipment off of people’s hands so long as it still runs a relevant network operating system (for things that can’t be run in a VM anyways.) One of the goals that I have in regards to CI is that each build will have all of the core plugins integration tested with their respective platforms, and in some cases hardware is required.\n","id":"https://blog.graysonhead.net/posts/runcible/","title":"Runcible: Declarative Network Automation"},"https://blog.graysonhead.net/posts/rust-tcp/":{"body":"As someone who came to Rust from high level languages, lower level networking was something\nthat I was very excited to work with in Rust. While Python's TCP and UDP implementations are\ngreat, the speed of Python often felt very constraining when writing services that needed\nto move lots of data quickly and concurrently. \nI was glad to discover that working with the async implementations of TCP and UDP sockets in\nRust using Tokio was quite intuitive, for the most part. While getting traffic flowing was\neasy, getting traffic flowing reliably required some steps beyond the boilerplate in the \ndocumentation. So, let my lessons be your lessons, lets send some segments!\nTCP Basics\nFrankly, TCP is a complicated way of getting data from point A to point B. There are a lot \nof steps to set up, send data, acknowledge the receipt of data, and terminate the connection.\nFortunately, the OS handles most of this for us. The sockets our program will interact\nwith seem a lot like magical data gateways, and that is the point of TCP in a nutshell. \nCompared to User Datagram Protocl (UDP), TCP has a lot of advantages. Namely:\n\nDelivery order of data is guaranteed\nRe-transmission of data is automatic if not acknowledged by the other side\nFlow and Congestion control\nYou can easily send blocs of data larger than your network's Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU)\n\nBut, there is a price to pay:\n\nPrograms using TCP are often more complex. This is primarily due to keeping track of more connection states\nTCP itself has some overhead, a system using many TCP sessions may use more memory than one using UDP for \nthe same purpose\nDue to complex flow handling and congestion control algorithms, sometimes its harder to troubleshoot TCP performance issues\n\nGenerally, TCP is useful if you need guaranteed delivery of data in a specific order. It can also reduce the complexity of \nprograms that need a lot of bidirectional connections between a single server and multiple clients. It also can make it \neasier to send large blocs of data larger than your MTU, but there are no shortage of libraries that make this just as easy with\nUDP.\nGetting Started: Streams and Listeners\nLets get some connections going. Lets start a project and add a dependency for our async runtime, Tokio:\ncargo new rust-tcp-tutorial  \ncargo add tokio --features socket2 --features macros --features rt-multi-thread --features net --features sync --features io-util\n\nNext, we will add two rust files in /src/bin/:\n// src/bin/server.rs\nuse tokio::net::TcpListener;\n\n#[tokio::main]\nasync fn main() {\n    let bind_addr = \"0.0.0.0:1234\";\n    listen(bind_addr).await;\n}\n\nasync fn listen(bind_addr: &amp;str) {\n    let listener = TcpListener::bind(bind_addr).await.unwrap();\n    loop {\n        let (stream, _) = listener.accept().await.unwrap();\n        println!(\"Connection from {}\", stream.peer_addr().unwrap());\n    }\n}\n\n// src/bin/client.rs\nuse tokio::net::TcpStream;\n\n#[tokio::main]\nasync fn main() {\n    let server_addr = \"127.0.0.1:1234\";\n    let stream: TcpStream = TcpStream::connect(server_addr).await.unwrap();\n    println!(\"Connected to {}\", stream.peer_addr().unwrap());\n}\n\n\nOur first example doesn't do much useful. If you run the two programs at the same time, you \nwill see that all they do is initiate a connection.\nYou can run any rust file in /src/bin like this:\ncargo run --bin server\ncargo run --bin client\nOn the server, you will get the output:\nConnection from 127.0.0.1:55586\n\nAnd on the client:\nConnected to 127.0.0.1:1234\n\nTaking a closer look at what is happening thus far: On the server,\nwe are binding to a socket address, which is represented by a bind IP and port. A bind address\nis a mechanism to inform the host operating system upon which interfaces this listener will be bound.\nFor instance, say we have a system with the following Interface layout:\neth0 10.1.1.15\neth1 172.16.0.25\nlo 127.0.0.1\n\nIf the bind address were set to 127.0.0.1:1234, any request to eth0 or eth1 would fail (usually with\na connection refused error), but a request sent to the local loopback address of 127.0.0.1 with a \ndestination port of 1234 would succeed.\nA bind address of of 10.5.5.15:1234 would allow connections to eth0 but not eth1 or the local loopback.\nIf you want to bind to all available interfaces, you can use an bind IP of 0.0.0.0:1234.\nThe call to TcpListener::bind(), unsurprisingly returns a TcpListener. \nOnce a client connects, we can call listener.accept() to get a TcpStream\nfor this connection. This is the mechanism that allows you to send and receive data to and from this client.\nOn the client side, you will notice that TcpStream::connect() of course also gives us a TcpStream. This is \nconvenient as there can be a lot of commonality in the way clients and servers interact.\nSo, to sum up, a TCP Server binds to a port, which returns a Listener. These Listeners then give us Streams, and \nstreams are what we will use in the next section to actually send and receive data. \nUsing Streams\nBefore getting into some examples, I want to point out that the Tokio docs are a wonderful resource, and you\nwill see the skeleton of the examples in a lot of production code. But, they quite minimal, and they don't go over (or at least don't explain)\nsome of the more common pitfalls you may run into. The following not-so-minimal example will show a lot of this behavior.\nExtending our previous code, lets add relay functionality to the server:\n// src/bin/server.rs\nuse std::{error::Error, io};\nuse tokio::{\n    io::{AsyncReadExt, Interest},\n    net::{TcpListener, TcpStream},\n};\n\n#[tokio::main]\nasync fn main() {\n    let bind_addr = \"0.0.0.0:1234\";\n    listen(bind_addr).await;\n}\n\nasync fn listen(bind_addr: &amp;str) {\n    let listener = TcpListener::bind(bind_addr).await.unwrap();\n    loop {\n        let (stream, _) = listener.accept().await.unwrap();\n        tokio::spawn(async move {\n            handle_stream(stream).await.unwrap();\n        });\n    }\n}\n\nasync fn handle_stream(stream: TcpStream) -&gt; Result&lt;(), Box&lt;dyn Error&gt;&gt; {\n    println!(\"Connection from {}\", stream.peer_addr().unwrap());\n    let mut reply_queue: Vec&lt;Vec&lt;u8&gt;&gt; = Vec::new();\n    let mut buf: [u8; 1024];\n    loop {\n        let ready = stream\n            .ready(Interest::READABLE | Interest::WRITABLE)\n            .await?;\n        if ready.is_readable() {\n\t    buf = [0; 1024];\n            match stream.try_read(&amp;mut buf) {\n                Ok(n) =&gt; {\n                    println!(\"read {} bytes\", n);\n                    let mut result_buffer: Vec&lt;u8&gt; = Vec::with_capacity(n);\n                    buf.take(n as u64).read_to_end(&amp;mut result_buffer).await?;\n                    reply_queue.push(buf.to_vec());\n                }\n                Err(ref e) if e.kind() == io::ErrorKind::WouldBlock =&gt; {\n                    continue;\n                }\n                Err(e) =&gt; {\n                    return Err(e.into());\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\n        if ready.is_writable() {\n            if let Some(msg) =  reply_queue.pop() {\n                match stream.try_write(&amp;msg) {\n                    Ok(n) =&gt; {\n                        println!(\"Wrote {} bytes\", n);\n                    }\n                    Err(ref e) if e.kind() == io::ErrorKind::WouldBlock =&gt; {\n                        continue;\n                    }\n                    Err(e) =&gt; {\n                        return Err(e.into());\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n// src/bin/client.rs\nuse std::error::Error;\nuse std::io;\nuse tokio::io::AsyncReadExt;\nuse tokio::net::TcpStream;\n\n#[tokio::main]\nasync fn main() {\n    let server_addr = \"127.0.0.1:1234\";\n    let stream: TcpStream = TcpStream::connect(server_addr).await.unwrap();\n    println!(\"Connected to {}\", stream.peer_addr().unwrap());\n    send_request(stream).await.unwrap();\n}\n\nasync fn send_request(stream: TcpStream) -&gt; Result&lt;(), Box&lt;dyn Error&gt;&gt; {\n    loop {\n        stream.writable().await?;\n        match stream.try_write(b\"Hello!\") {\n            Ok(n) =&gt; {\n                println!(\"Wrote {} bytes\", n);\n                break;\n            }\n            Err(ref e) if e.kind() == io::ErrorKind::WouldBlock =&gt; {\n                continue;\n            }\n            Err(e) =&gt; {\n                return Err(e.into());\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    let mut buf: [u8; 4096];\n    loop {\n        stream.readable().await?;\n        buf = [0; 4096];\n        match stream.try_read(&amp;mut buf) {\n            Ok(n) =&gt; {\n                let mut vec = Vec::with_capacity(n);\n                buf.take(n as u64).read_to_end(&amp;mut vec).await?;\n                let s = String::from_utf8(buf.to_vec()).unwrap();\n                println!(\"Got reply from host: {}\", s);\n                break;\n            }\n            Err(ref e) if e.kind() == io::ErrorKind::WouldBlock =&gt; {\n                continue;\n            }\n            Err(e) =&gt; return Err(e.into()),\n        }\n    }\n\n    Ok(())\n}\n\nLets go over some of the more important parts of these changes. \nThe client is quite a naive example, as it very deterministically sends a request and then waits for a reply, but we\ndo see the start of two patterns you will see throughout the rest of this tutorial. Specifically, the try_read and try_write\nmatch blocks.\nloop {\n    stream.writable().await?;\n    match stream.try_write(b\"Hello!\") {\n        Ok(n) =&gt; {\n            println!(\"Wrote {} bytes\", n);\n            break;\n        }\n        Err(ref e) if e.kind() == io::ErrorKind::WouldBlock =&gt; {\n            continue;\n        }\n        Err(e) =&gt; {\n            return Err(e.into());\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nSo first, we check to see if the stream is actually ready to be written to. It often can't, for various reasons. And \nsometimes it thinks it is, but it actually isn't. Notice that this method is async and thus is awaited. \nThere is a lot of really cool logic happening in this one line. On Linux operating systems, when Tokio\ncreated the TcpStream, it registered an epoll waiter for the stream. When we\nawait on the writeable method, Tokio puts the task to sleep until the Kernel informs us either that the stream is\nready to be written to, or that data has been received\nand is ready to be read on the stream. What this means is, this task will consume practically no system resources \nuntil there is data for it to process. Pretty neat, huh?\nNext, we match the result of the try_write method. Now, this isn't async, but try_write will ensure that the call\ndoesn't block on IO unnecessarily. However, this creates a quandry, as sometimes the writable method gives us false\npositives because of weird messy kernel programming reasons. As a result, we need to be prepared to deal with that, and \nwe deal with it by matching on the WouldBlock error type. If we get this Error, we restart the loop and await it again.\nEventually, we will enter the loop on a true positive, and be able to write our data. \nWhile this arrangement may sound complex, it can reduce the busy time of programs doing network IO significantly.\nReading response uses mostly the same pattern, but with more logic to handle copying data from buffers:\nloop {\n        let mut buf: [u8; 4096];\n        stream.readable().await?;\n        buf = [0; 4096];\n        match stream.try_read(&amp;mut buf) {\n            Ok(n) =&gt; {\n                let mut vec = Vec::with_capacity(n);\n                buf.take(n as u64).read_to_end(&amp;mut vec).await?;\n                let s = String::from_utf8(buf.to_vec()).unwrap();\n                println!(\"Got reply from host: {}\", s);\n                break;\n            }\n            Err(ref e) if e.kind() == io::ErrorKind::WouldBlock =&gt; {\n                continue;\n            }\n            Err(e) =&gt; return Err(e.into()),\n        }\n    }\n\nNow, for the server. Up first, our listen function is now spawning a Tokio Task on each new stream.\nasync fn listen(bind_addr: &amp;str) {\n    let listener = TcpListener::bind(bind_addr).await.unwrap();\n    loop {\n        let (stream, _) = listener.accept().await.unwrap();\n        tokio::spawn(async move {\n            handle_stream(stream).await.unwrap();\n        });\n    }\n}\n\nKeep in mind, Tokio Tasks are not threads. Thread count is determined by the Tokio runtime. Tasks will \nrun on a thread until they await, at which point another task will usually take its place. So don't feel bad about\nspinning up a bunch of tasks to handle individual client connections. Unless you are doing blocking io operations in them,\nin which case you should feel bad.\nNotice how we are spawning a task for each stream, and running the handle_stream function inside of it. While not \nalways necessary, this is a very common pattern for applications that want to process traffic for multiple clients\nsimultaneously. This also takes advantage of async IO, as the program will never block while waiting for messages \nfrom hosts that haven't sent any.\nAnd now, lets break the handle_stream function into a few distinct sections:\nprintln!(\"Connection from {}\", stream.peer_addr().unwrap());\nlet mut reply_queue: Vec&lt;Vec&lt;u8&gt;&gt; = Vec::new();\nlet mut buf: [u8; 1024];\n\nIn this \"preamble\", we are setting up a mutable reply_queue which we will use to store messages that we want to\nrelay back to the client. Since each client's stream exists within its own Tokio task running this function, this\nisolates communication per client by default, which is a nice aspect of this pattern and lends itself well to serving\nmany clients simultaneously.\nNow, getting into the loop:\n let ready = stream\n            .ready(Interest::READABLE | Interest::WRITABLE)\n            .await?;\n\nThis method returns a Ready object describing the current\nstate of the Stream. This allows you to handle one write operation, or one read operation per loop. This also ensures that\nyour writes don't block your reads, your reads don't block your writes. Since it is awaited, it also ensures that the \nTask will sleep while it has no ability to perform IO.\nThere will be a lot of cases in more complex programs where you need to split your TcpStream into a WriteHalf and a ReadHalf, but that is\na topic for another day.\nNow, lets run the code. But first make sure you know where your ctrl + c keys are:\nClient:\nConnected to 127.0.0.1:1234\nWrote 6 bytes\nGot reply from host: Hello!\n\nServer:\nread 6 bytes\nWrote 6 bytes\nWrote 0 bytes\nread 0 bytes\nWrote 0 bytes\nread 0 bytes\nWrote 0 bytes\nread 0 bytes\nWrote 0 bytes\nread 0 bytes\nWrote 0 bytes\nread 0 bytes\nWrote 0 bytes\nread 0 bytes\nWrote 0 bytes\nread 0 bytes\nWrote 0 bytes\nread 0 bytes\nWrote 0 bytes\nread 0 bytes\nWrote 0 bytes\nread 0 bytes\nWrote 0 bytes\nread 0 bytes\n...\n\nWhats Up With the Zero Byte Buffer?\nWell, that is something...\nWhat is happening here is some convention surrounding Rusts buffers (At least those that implement the Read trait) that isn't exactly obvious. \nIf you go down the buffer rabbit hole far enough, you will find this rather vauge description on std::io::Read's doc page:\n\nIf the return value of this method is Ok(n), then implementations must guarantee that 0 &lt;= n &lt;= buf.len(). A nonzero n value indicates that the buffer buf has been filled in with n bytes of data from this source. If n is 0, then it can indicate one of two scenarios:\n\nThis reader has reached its “end of file” and will likely no longer be able to produce bytes. Note that this does not mean that the reader will always no longer be able to produce bytes. As an example, on Linux, this method will call the recv syscall for a TcpStream, where returning zero indicates the connection was shut down correctly. While for File, it is possible to reach the end of file and get zero as result, but if more data is appended to the file, future calls to read will return more data.\nThe buffer specified was 0 bytes in length.\n\n\nWhat this usually means in the context of a TCPStream, is that the other side closed the connection. When the TCPStream on the client side falls out of scope as the client unwinds, it \ncloses It's side. Since the buffer for the TCPStream will no longer produce any more bytes, it is considered closed. In most cases, you can interpret an Ok(0) result from this\nmethod as a graceful disconnect. So lets modify the match block to reflect that.\nif ready.is_readable() {\n            buf = [0; 1024];\n            match stream.try_read(&amp;mut buf) {\n                Ok(0) =&gt; {\n                    println!(\"Client disconnected\");\n                    return Ok(());\n                }\n                Ok(n) =&gt; {\n                    println!(\"read {} bytes\", n);\n                    let mut result_buffer: Vec&lt;u8&gt; = Vec::with_capacity(n);\n                    buf.take(n as u64).read_to_end(&amp;mut result_buffer).await?;\n                    reply_queue.push(result_buffer.to_vec());\n                }\n                Err(ref e) if e.kind() == io::ErrorKind::WouldBlock =&gt; {\n                    continue;\n                }\n                Err(e) =&gt; {\n                    return Err(e.into());\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\nNow, when we get a 0 length buffer from the try_read method, the TCPStream handler method will exit, and all of its connections and buffers\nwill be automatically cleaned up as they fall out of scope.\nLets run the example code again:\nConnection from 127.0.0.1:58682\nread 6 bytes\nWrote 6 bytes\nClient disconnected\n\nWhile this behavior isn't very intuitive to people not already familiar, it can be dealt with in a pretty succinct way. And, as you can see, now that you know what it \nmeans you have a program that will reliably handle all manner of connections, disconnections, reconnections, etc without having to address all those specific cases.\nSome Other Pitfalls\nWait, How Did I Just Send Data to a Disconnected Host?\nWell, the short answer is, you didn't. It just looked like you did.\nImagine this scenario:\nTwo systems have a long-running TCP Connection between them. \nThe server crashes or otherwise loses it's connection to the client.\nThe client then sends some data via the try_write method, which succeeds. What the heck?\nWell, what we've succeeded in doing is writing data into a kernel networking buffer on a stream that, as far as the kernel is concerned, is still alive and healthy.\nNetworking problems are not uncommon, and many of them are recoverable. TCP is a protocol that, as mentioned in the intro, is capable of retrying and retransmitting lost data.\nThis takes time though, and by the time the complete retransmission process has finished, our program will have long moved on to another context (assuming it isn't blocking on \nIO, which as previously established, is a bad thing.)\nHow has the kernel not realized there is a problem yet?\nWell, in the case of Linux, the answer is hiding in proc:\n$ cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_keepalive_time\n7200\n$ cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_keepalive_probes \n9\n$ cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_keepalive_intvl \n75\n\nThese are generally the default values for the three parameters of a TCP Connection that govern detecting failed connections.\nAs is so excellently explained by wikipedia:\n\n\nKeepalive time is the duration between two keepalive transmissions in idle condition. TCP keepalive period is required to be configurable and by default is set to no less than 2 hours.\nKeepalive interval is the duration between two successive keepalive retransmissions, if acknowledgement to the previous keepalive transmission is not received.\nKeepalive retry is the number of retransmissions to be carried out before declaring that remote end is not available\n\n\nSo, in the case of an idle connection, it will take more than 2 hours for a TCP connection to be considered failed, at which point calling try_write will result in an IOError.\nBut, there is something we can do about it. Upon creating TCP Connections, the Kernel will allow us to pass in our own values for each of these settings. Unfortunately, Tokio doesn't provide convenience methods for these as far as I can tell, so we need to do a little bit of excessive type conversions:\nlet stream = TcpStream::connect(&amp;socket_addr_string).await.unwrap()\nlet stream: std::net::TcpStream = stream.into_std().unwrap();\nlet socket: socket2::Socket = socket2::Socket::from(stream);\nlet keepalive = TcpKeepalive::new()\n    .with_time(Duration::from_secs(10))\n    .with_interval(Duration::from_secs((5));\nsocket.set_tcp_keepalive(&amp;keepalive).unwrap();\nlet stream: std::net::TcpStream = socket.into();\nlet stream: tokio::net::TcpStream = tokio::net::TcpStream::from_std(stream).unwrap();\n\nWhile TCP Keepalive is a pretty low-overhead operation, bear in mind that you probably don't want to set a one-second interval on a service\nthat maintains tens of thousands of connections.\nNow, I do hear a few of you yelling at your monitor that I should have just constructed the socket using a socket2 builder in the first place, but I disagree because of...\nDNS Lookups and Socket Address Type Conversions\nOne thing you may want to keep in mind, especially if you are going to implement connection retry functionality into your program, is where your DNS lookups take place.\nIn a robust long-running daemon, you probably want to perform a DNS lookup on each successive connection, otherwise you may not discover until restarting your application\nthat the DNS records on the other side changed. This can result in really annoying behavior that frustrates operators.\nSo, where do DNS lookups take place?\nA big clue can be gleaned by looking at the SocketAddr type:\npub enum SocketAddr {\n    V4(SocketAddrV4),\n    V6(SocketAddrV6),\n}\n\nSure enough, there is no such thing as a SocketAddr that contains a DNS name, it must either be an IPv4 or IPv6 address + destination port. So, we can safely assume\nthat any time we convert from an address string to a SocketAddr, a DNS lookup must take place. This is one place where it is very easy for blocking IO to sneak it's \nway into your otherwise async application. For instance, if you construct a socket in a non-async framework, and then convert it to an async socket, you may have performed\na non-async DNS lookup.\nNow, in some cases you may want the lookup to only be performed once, in which case feel free to stick a conversion from string to SocketAddr directly in your clap arguments, in which case your application will perform exactly one DNS lookup when the arguments are parsed and converted.\nBut, if that isn't the behavior you want, feel free to keep passing around you addresses as strings (or another intermediary type) for a bit longer.\nClosing\nDon't be intimidated by lower level network protocols in Rust, or any language really. While they tend to require a little more work to get right than, say a HTTP REST call, they still have\ntheir place in modern software engineering. Especially if you have a lot of data you need to get somewhere really fast with as little overhead as possible. \nJust bear in mind, there are definitely some ways to shoot yourself in the foot. So make sure you test well, and have a basic understanding of what is actually going on \nwith the magical data portal that is a TCPStream.\nYou can access the complete source code used as an example here.\n","id":"https://blog.graysonhead.net/posts/rust-tcp/","title":"Async TCP in Rust Without Shooting Yourself in the Foot"},"https://blog.graysonhead.net/posts/sane-nix-flake-rust/":{"body":"Nix is not just a language, package manager, or operating system, but an ecosystem with remarkable capabilities. \nThis tutorial is targeted for someone who is getting their feet wet with Nix, using the Nix\npackage manager on Linux or MacOS. But, it also demonstrates a development workflow\nthat can be used by other crazy people like me that daily drive NixOS.\nI started using Nix about a year and a half ago, and since then I've \ngone deep down the rabbit hole. To the point where my entire home setup runs \nNixOS primarily. Having a consistent experience across all\nof my computers is a wonderful thing, and one of the best parts is \nhaving truly 100% isolated development environments. \nWhile bootstrapping these is a bit more work, (due to an intentional complete \nlack of development tools in my system path), having near \nguaranteed isolation between projects is \nquite an incredible thing.\nThe core components of this development workflow center around Nix Flakes and Direnv.\nFlake Templates\nDue to the increased initial cost of setting up a new project, its almost mandatory to \ncreate standardized Flake templates to save yourself time when kickstarting a new project.\nI maintain a repo of Flake Templates customized for my use, but they are MIT licensed so feel free to use them.\nToday we are going to explore the Rust templates that I still actively use.\nSimple: Naersk + Nixpkgs\nHere is a simple, but useful, Rust Flake example:\n{\n  # This is our input set, it contains the channels we will construct the flake from.\n  inputs = {\n    # Flake-utils allows us to easily support multiple architectures.\n    flake-utils.url = \"github:numtide/flake-utils\";\n    # Naersk is a zero-configuration zero-codegen solution to packaging Rust.\n    naersk.url = \"github:nix-community/naersk\";\n    # Nixpkgs is the main package repo for Nix, we will use it to bring in all of our\n    # libraries and tools.\n    nixpkgs.url = \"github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixpkgs-unstable\";\n  };\n\n  # This is the output set, Nix and other Flakes will be able to consume the attributes\n  # in the output set.\n  outputs = { self, flake-utils, naersk, nixpkgs }:\n    # We wrap the entire output set in this flake-utils function, which builds the flake\n    # for each architecture type supported by nix.\n    flake-utils.lib.eachDefaultSystem (system:\n      let\n        # This sets up nixpkgs, where we will pull our dependencies from\n        pkgs = (import nixpkgs) {\n          # You can insert overlays here by calling `inherit system overlays;` \n          inherit system;\n        };\n\n        # This sets up naersk, which we will use later.\n        naersk' = pkgs.callPackage naersk { };\n\n        # Here we can add non-rust dependencies that our program requires *at run time*.\n        buildInputs = with pkgs; [\n\n        ];\n\n        # here we can add non-rust dependencies that our program requires *at build time*.\n        nativeBuildInputs = with pkgs; [\n\n        ];\n      in\n      rec {\n        # Build this with `nix build`, run it with `nix run`\n        defaultPackage = packages.app;\n        packages =\n          {\n            app = naersk'.buildPackage {\n              # Naersk will look for a `Cargo.toml` in this directory\n              src = ./.;\n              # Our buildinputs from above are specified here\n              nativeBuildInputs = nativeBuildInputs;\n              buildInputs = buildInputs;\n            };\n            contianer = pkgs.dockerTools.buildImage\n              {\n                name = \"app\";\n                config = {\n                  entrypoint = [ \"${packages.app}/bin/app\" ];\n                };\n              };\n          };\n\n        # This will be entered by direnv, or by manually running `nix shell`. This ensures\n        # that our development environment will have all the correct tools at the correct\n        # version for this project.\n        devShell = pkgs.mkShell {\n          # Here we add any tools that we want in our dev-shell but aren't required to build\n          # our application.\n          nativeBuildInputs = with pkgs;\n            [\n              nixpkgs-fmt\n              cmake\n              rustc\n              cargo\n              clippy\n            ] ++ buildInputs ++ nativeBuildInputs;\n          # The above line merges our buildInputs into the devshell, so we have them when\n          # using cargo tools from inside our devshell.\n        };\n      }\n    );\n}\n\n\nYou can setup this repo locally with this command:\nnix flake new --template github:graysonhead/nix-templates#rust-naersk ./changeme\n\nThis is the base template I use for any simple rust project I use that will be based off of\nnixpgks and not require a nightly (or otherwise specific) build of Rust. Its a good starting\npoint, and it is already pretty flexible. For instance, if you are building something that\nrequires openssl you only need to change one line to add it:\n{\n  buildInputs = with pkgs; [\n    openssl\n  ];\n}\n\nUsing it is also simple. First, you shoud familiarize yourself with the output of nix flake show:\n$ nix flake show\ngit+file:///home/grayson/RustProjects/naersk-template\n├───defaultPackage\n│   ├───aarch64-darwin: package 'naersk-template-0.1.0'\n│   ├───aarch64-linux: package 'naersk-template-0.1.0'\n│   ├───x86_64-darwin: package 'naersk-template-0.1.0'\n│   └───x86_64-linux: package 'naersk-template-0.1.0'\n└───devShell\n    ├───aarch64-darwin: development environment 'nix-shell'\n    ├───aarch64-linux: development environment 'nix-shell'\n    ├───x86_64-darwin: development environment 'nix-shell'\n    └───x86_64-linux: development environment 'nix-shell'\n\n\nHere we can see a tree of the output set (the set that the nix flake returns) in a more visually appealing form. This command is \nextremely useful on more complex flakes with dozens or even hundreds of outputs, but here it gives us a good idea of what is going on.\nFirst, notice that both our defaultPackage and devShell have outputs for each architecture already. This is a result of the \nflake-utils.lib.eachDefaultSystem function that we wrapped our output set in. It ensures that the flake is repeated for each system type.\nAs a result, our flake will work on Linux and MacOS on both x86 and ARM systems. Best of all, we got that functionality practically for free!\nSince we defined a defaultPackage, we can build the application by running nix build, or run it with nix run. You can enter the development\nshell with nix develop, which will allow you to compile your program with native tools such as cargo as well as clippy.\nTo target a specific output, you can simply trace down the tree to your desired output, and call nix build or nix run like this:\nnix run .#defaultPackage.x86_64-linux, or whatever arch you are on.\nContainers\nAnother nice thing about Nix flakes, is that you can easily build \ndocker containers without needing a fragile dockerfile. For instance, you can\nmodify the output set and add a seperate output for building a container image:\n{\n    packages =\n          {\n            app = naersk'.buildPackage {\n              # Naersk will look for a `Cargo.toml` in this directory\n              src = ./.;\n              # Our buildinputs from above are specified here\n              nativeBuildInputs = nativeBuildInputs;\n              buildInputs = buildInputs;\n            };\n            contianer = pkgs.dockerTools.buildImage\n              {\n                name = \"app\";\n                config = {\n                  entrypoint = [ \"${packages.app}/bin/app\" ];\n                };\n              };\n          };\n}\n\nThis allows you to build a container image by running nix build .#container, which\ncan be loaded into docker via docker load -i ./result. \nMulti-Workspace Projects\nFlakes also allow you to utilize workspaces as well, although the process for doing that \nin Naersk isn't exactly straightforward. \nTo build a project in a workspace, you can add this to your package output definition:\n{\n  example-workspaced-app = naersk'.buildPackage {\n    name = \"example-workspace\";\n    src = ./.;\n    cargoBuildOptions = x: x ++ [ \"-p\" \"example-workspace\" ];\n  };\n}\n\nThis assumes that your workspace (with its own Cargo.toml file) is located in ./example-workspace.\nNote that you will also need to ensure that your main Cargo.toml file has an entry\nfor this workspace, like this:\n[workspace]\nmembers = [\n    \"example-workspace\"\n]\n\nCargo technically doesn't need this entry to function, but Naersk does, and you\nwon't be able to build or run anything in that workspace without it.\nNightly Rust\nIf you want to use nightly rust (or a version seperate from Nixpkgs), you can use the oxalica/rust-overlay. \nHere is a full example:\n{\n  inputs = {\n    flake-utils.url = \"github:numtide/flake-utils\";\n    naersk.url = \"github:nix-community/naersk\";\n    rust-overlay.url = \"github:oxalica/rust-overlay\";\n    nixpkgs.url = \"github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixpkgs-unstable\";\n  };\n\n  outputs = { self, flake-utils, naersk, nixpkgs, rust-overlay }:\n    flake-utils.lib.eachDefaultSystem (system:\n      let\n        overlays = [ (import rust-overlay) ];\n        pkgs = (import nixpkgs) {\n          inherit system overlays;\n        };\n\n        naersk' = pkgs.callPackage naersk { };\n        buildInputs = with pkgs; [\n        ];\n        nativeBuildInputs = with pkgs; [\n          # This sets up the rust suite, automatically selecting the latest nightly version\n          (rust-bin.selectLatestNightlyWith\n            (toolchain: toolchain.default.override {\n              extensions = [ \"rust-src\" \"clippy\" ];\n            }))\n        ];\n      in\n      rec {\n        # For `nix build` &amp; `nix run`:\n        defaultPackage = packages.naersk-nightly;\n        packages = rec {\n          naersk-nightly = naersk'.buildPackage {\n            src = ./.;\n            nativeBuildInputs = nativeBuildInputs;\n            buildInputs = buildInputs;\n          };\n        };\n\n        # For `nix develop`:\n        devShell = pkgs.mkShell {\n          nativeBuildInputs = with pkgs; [\n            cargo-expand\n            nixpkgs-fmt\n            cmake\n          ] ++ buildInputs ++ nativeBuildInputs;\n        };\n      }\n    );\n}\n\n\nMaking Development Shells Automatic\nUsing direnv, and nix-direnv, you can make the activation of your development\nenvironment automatic. Add an .envrc file in the root of your repo with the line:\nuse flake\n\nAnd then run the command direnv allow from this directory. Your development shell will now be activated any time you change directory to that location.\nThis means that your entire environment will automatically switch whenever you change between projects, meaning you don't have to deal with rustup and\ntoolchains whenever you switch between a nightly and stable Rust project.\nYou can also get IDE/terminal editor plugins that allow you to use this environment as well, so that your rust-analyzer version is appropriate to the version\nof Rust you are developing on. I use cab404.vscode-direnv for vscode, and direnv-vim for vim.\nBonus Round: Nix Party Tricks\nLets look at some other fun stuff you can trivially do now that you have this set up. \nRun a program from a remote git repo without permanently installing it in your profile or system path:\n$ nix run github:nixos/nixpkgs/nixpkgs-unstable#hello\n\nYou can also cross-compile it to a different architecture (requires for boot.binfmt.emulatedSystems to be set appropriately on NixOS):\n$ nix build github:nixos/nixpkgs/nixpkgs-unstable#legacyPackages.aarch64-linux.hello\n$ file result/bin/hello \nresult/bin/hello: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, ARM aarch64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /nix/store/rjpx52ch4508wrq8wjf5nnbsc6pr3158-glibc-2.37-8/lib/ld-linux-aarch64.so.1, for GNU/Linux 3.10.0, not stripped\n\nNeed to distribute your program via RPM or Deb? In most cases, this is trivial:\n$ nix bundle --bundler github:NixOS/bundlers#toDEB .#defaultPackage.x86_64-linux\n$ nix bundle --bundler github:NixOS/bundlers#toRPM .#defaultPackage.x86_64-linux\n\n","id":"https://blog.graysonhead.net/posts/sane-nix-flake-rust/","title":"Nix Powered Dev Environments: Rust"},"https://blog.graysonhead.net/posts/your-msp-sucks/":{"body":"One of the best jobs I ever had was at a small local managed service provider and software development firm. The constant customer interaction, plethora of technical challenges with insufficient manpower to fix them, and the companies desire to actually make money turned my coworkers and I into some of the most well-rounded IT engineers I’ve ever met. Yes, we can design you a public cloud on Vmware, Cloudstack, or Openstack. Sure, we can set up BGP edge routing for you. You need some basic programming done to integrate two products with sane APIs? Sure thing. And somehow we still found room to store gems such as “How to Read a P&amp;L”, “Contract Writing 101”, and “How to Convince People to Sign 6 Figure Checks”.\nBefore you think that I’m writing this just to gasconade, I was far from the only employee that had a story like this. The secret sauce in our ability to step into an unfamiliar situation and get shit done, was that we were constantly in an unfamiliar situation. And we lived in an environment that had us near constantly in an unfamiliar or uncomfortable situation. We were the people that showed up when the single IT guy for a medium sized company was out of ideas, and we were the people that showed up to a new customer without backups that just lost data that essentially comprised their company, and we were the people that showed up after one of your IT people went rouge and tried to do as much damage as possible on the way out. Our world was filled with constant stress and worry that this might be the time our ability to read a manual and keep a cool head would finally fail us. Occasionally it did.\nAt the time, I hated it. There was no stability, no rest, and an endless torrent of other peoples problems that I had never seen before. But if I could go back and change anything about my career, I wouldn’t change my time at MSPs (but I also wouldn’t go back). It helped that I had a pair of amazing mentors, one of whom was a seasoned Systems Engineer/Programmer, and the other one happened to own the company. It was the perfect launchpad for my college-free career path, it was like rocket fuel for my career.\nIf you have the opportunity to work at an MSP, you should. Its experience that money can’t buy. But this article isn’t targeted at people who are looking for jobs, this article is targeted at people who are either currently running, or thinking about running MSPs.\nAll told now, I’ve lived at MSPs for a little less than a decade. I’ve worked for the big and small, old and new, great and horrible. I worked at one for 6 + years, and I’ve also worked for 3 at the same time. I’ve been everything from Tier 1 help-desk to manager to director. All told, if you count little stints of contracting here and there, I’ve either contracted or worked for about 8 different MSPs.\nWithout early and intentional intervention, even a successful MSP will have a tendency to fall into the “traps” I’m about to outline. If you are thinking about starting an MSP, pay close attention. I’m about to give you a glimpse into your future, and believe me, it sucks.\nYou Aren't Charging Enough, But You Can't Charge Enough\nAny kind of outsourcing is a race to the bottom. Standard rates for normal per-head tech support now is around $45–70 per person per month. This is less than most people’s cell phone bills. And granted, I’m talking remote-only basic computer support, but this is the bread and butter of most MSPs. When each of your customer’s employees is demanding a half an hour of your time on average each month (and this is probably a little low for the typical customer that would hire an MSP in the first place), you are talking about dollars of profit per head after the employee helping the customer gets paid. So the only thing you can do is start adding on services. A few years ago, this would actually get you a pretty decent living. Most tech companies had a serious bottleneck regarding marketing and sales, and they would give you 20–30% margins just to introduce their email platform, antivirus software, or productivity suite to your customers. And for hardware sales, the margins were often bigger. I remember selling a customer 50 computers at a 47% margin as a result of a few concurrent promotions our distributor was doing. That damn near covered the operating cost for that MSP for 2 months. But nowadays? You are lucky if you see 5%. And its hardly free money, you have to work at it. The amount of “mailbox money” you are getting from any modern SaaS company that you sell into your customer base is probably going to offset the cost of postage, but not much more.\nSo unless you are able to push datacenter gear in large quantities, where 20–25% margins are still realistic, this isn’t going to net you any profits. At best, it might help you close the gap between MRR and operational costs, but in all honesty its probably going to be more of a distraction than anything.\nYou Need to Use the Same Contract for ALL of Your Customers\nThis is by far one of the most important things you can do to offset the MSP pain. If one of your customers doesn’t want to get on board, drop them.\nYou can design a contract that is just flexible enough, while also allowing you to standardize how you get paid, and how you provide services for your customers. My recommendation would be to create a document that outlines all of your services, and then have a separate form specific to each customer that lays out which of those services they have purchased for you. Its super easy. You are generally going to wind up with a 3 tier “basic — essential — premium” sort of model. And there is going to be a standard distribution of customers across these three tiers, with most picking essential and a few big fish picking premium. And those big fish are where you are actually going to make some money. But don’t worry, you are going to spend all that money you just made trying to acquire more customers like them.\nThe most important reason for this, is consistency. Your employees need to understand how you make money, and they need to understand what they are and aren’t allowed to do for the customer without having to get a check. You can’t expect them to remember the special snowflake contract for each of your customers, and you can’t expect them to look it up every time Sally from Accounting at that underfunded non-profit needs help changing her toner cartridge. Any time they spend doing overhead tasks is time they aren’t spending making your customers happy.\nIf Your Operational Costs Aren’t Covered by Your Recurring Revenue, Your Time Is Limited\nThis one is pretty simple. If you can’t find a way to cover your operational costs with your recurring revenue, you are going to struggle and flail every month selling more labor than you have to try and cover the gap. That works for a few months, but eventually you accumulate more promises than you have people to fulfill them, and then you are screwed with no way out. Don’t do this. Cover your MRR from the start, when your operational costs are small, and don’t expand till you have MRR to cover the expansion.\nAnd for heaven’s sake, make your MRR customers sign contracts. The term doesn’t have to be ridiculously long, but you need time to find replacement customers if one of your big fish decides to leave.\nA Better Model\nWrite an Operations Manual\nUnless you hate taking vacations.\nIf you write it good enough, and you hire the right people, your training will consist of you handing it to people. For everyone else, it serves as an unambiguous reference in situations where you would normally get a phone call at a funeral and be “that uncle”.\nYour First Employee (Ideally You) Should Be a Programmer\nMSPs are tech companies, and MSPs require high operational efficiency. The kind of operational efficiency you aren’t going to get by buying off the shelf generic software. By the time you get around to hiring your first few Technicians, you should damn well know exactly what your workflow looks like. And you should then go and create workflow automation tools that fit that workflow like a glove. Then just keep building. Make a customer portal (it makes you look way more professional than your competitors with generically branded Connectwise portals), and then integrate it with everything you sell. A customer should be able to log into a website and see all existing tickets, incidents, upcoming bills, and all of the services they can buy from you. Make it easy, and make it completely unambiguous. Ambiguity is what kills operational efficiency, and workflow automation software kills ambiguity.\nBut this is a 10,000ft view. You could write a book on what I’ve said above. All I’ll say is; if you don’t know how to do it, find someone that does. But I’ll also say that if you have to find someone that knows how to do it, you should probably consider a different career unless you have a large pile of money you want to light on fire.\nRevolving Door Hiring\nThis is the most difficult thing, and the most worthwhile thing. You need to build your company in a way that it is accepting of entry level technicians, and give them just enough guard rails to help them get started, but not enough that they feel restricted. Find people that have built their own computers, find people that have modded video games, find people that use Linux (even if you are a windows shop.) Hire exclusively on three factors; Are they self-driven? Do they like learning new skills? Do they dress and speak presentably?\nEventually you are going to reach a point where your employees out-learn the position they occupy. Due to the nature of MSPs, you probably won’t have grown enough to offer your first few senior employees the positions that are worthy of their new skill-sets. What you do at this moment is critical, many people will stretch and find money to promote their first employees to positions that don’t exist, and that the business can’t justify. Don’t do it. Give them the most glowing letter of recommendation ever, and don’t fire them before they find a new job, but you need to let the door revolve. MSPs serve an important role in the tech job industry, they are the shitty jobs everyone takes as an entry level tech to go find a less shitty job once they have some experience. If you are just starting out, its unlikely that you are going to be able to pay to retain top tier talent; so don’t waste your money or time trying. Just let the door revolve, and go start a few more careers.\nFind Out What You Are Really Good At, and Stop Doing Everything Else\nIf you are successful, hire the right people, and automate your workflows to a militant degree, you will eventually find a niche.\nOne of the companies I worked for found a niche in Business Continuity services. Our mistake was not pivoting to doing BCS exclusively while we had the opportunity to do so. If you look at a lot of software companies in the MSP space, they found a niche and then started selling their software or services to other MSPs. This is the dream. Even if you stay in the service industry, its way easier to sell yourself as a specialized provider (or better yet, software provider that offers services) than generic catch all tech support. And there is the possibility you will actually make money. So when you see your opportunity to jump ship and fill a niche; Do it.\nAll MSP markets outside of dedicated government contractors are a race to the bottom. You might not cut costs, but your competition will. And they are probably better at it than you.\n","id":"https://blog.graysonhead.net/posts/your-msp-sucks/","title":"Your Managed Service Provider Sucks"}},"docInfo":{"https://blog.graysonhead.net/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://blog.graysonhead.net/about/":{"body":27,"title":0},"https://blog.graysonhead.net/posts/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://blog.graysonhead.net/posts/bevy-proc-earth-1/":{"body":1193,"title":6},"https://blog.graysonhead.net/posts/bevy-proc-earth-2/":{"body":1277,"title":8},"https://blog.graysonhead.net/posts/bevy-proc-earth-3/":{"body":1268,"title":6},"https://blog.graysonhead.net/posts/greif/":{"body":855,"title":2},"https://blog.graysonhead.net/posts/nix-flake-rust-bevy/":{"body":466,"title":6},"https://blog.graysonhead.net/posts/nixos-hype/":{"body":1345,"title":3},"https://blog.graysonhead.net/posts/runcible/":{"body":1455,"title":4},"https://blog.graysonhead.net/posts/rust-tcp/":{"body":1923,"title":7},"https://blog.graysonhead.net/posts/sane-nix-flake-rust/":{"body":958,"title":5},"https://blog.graysonhead.net/posts/your-msp-sucks/":{"body":1046,"title":4}},"length":13},"lang":"English"};
