I'm Grayson. Here is some of the stuff I'm interested in:

* Software Engineering (Rust, Python, Nix, ...)
* Compute Orchestration platforms (Openstack, Kubernetes)
* Game Development
* Offroad exploration
* Car and boat restoration

I'm also love aviation, and I'm currently working on getting my private license, so there will probably be some posts about that as well.
